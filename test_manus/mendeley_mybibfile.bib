abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sustainability and the optimal provision of the various ecosystem services is an essential task in forest management. In this study, we deal with the optimization of forest tending to achieve the maximal long-term provision of financial incomes from wood at a minimal level of ecological risks for selected small ownership unit. The methods of interactive decision maps and reasonable goals (IDM/RGM) were connected with a modern forest growth simulator to investigate the four-dimensional optimization space and to produce the complete set of Pareto optimal solutions. The four different types of forest owners as potential decision-makers were simulated, and precise management goals in multidimensional target space were defined. Then, the optimal tending system for each forest owner in three stands, differing by the degree of the naturalness of the species composition, was detected. The multi-criteria analysis suggests that predominantly economically oriented forest management still prevails in the Czech and Slovak Republics, which can be as a source of conflicts among forest owners and other stakeholders. The existence of trade-offs between biodiversity, ecological stability and wood production and different owners' demands must be taken into account. The possibility of balancing the management risks and wood provision according to the owner's and other stakeholders' demands with the aid of the easy-to-apply IDM/RGM methods (and the careful assistance of a specialist experienced in multi-criteria optimization) was introduced. At the same time, the application of real integrative management in small forest areas was demonstrated in practice. After the change of paradigm in forest management, the applied methods should prevent increasing conflicts among owners and society in former socialist countries, which have undergone a fundamental transformation in terms of forest ownership in recent decades.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In urbanising landscapes, planning for sustainable biodiversity occurs in a context of multifunctional land use. Important conditions for species persistence are habitat quality, the amount and configuration of habitat and the permeability of the landscape matrix. For planning purposes, these determinants should be integrated into simple indicators for spatial conditions of persistence probability. We propose a framework of three related indices. The cohesion index is based on the ecology of metapopulations in a habitat network. We discuss how an indicator for species persistence in such a network could be developed. To translate this network index into an area index, we propose the concept of spatial cohesion. Habitat cohesion and spatial cohesion are defined and measured for single species or, at best, for species profiles. Since species differ in their perception of the same landscape, different species will rate different values of these indices for the same landscape. Because landscapes are rarely planned for single species, we further propose the index of landscape cohesion, which integrates the spatial cohesion indices of different species. Indices based on these concepts can be built into GIS tools for landscape assessment. We illustrate different applications of these indices, and emphasise the distinction between ecological and political decisions in developing and applying such tools.},

abstract = {Natural disturbances are a major source of spatial stand heterogeneity, initiating forest community turnover. Besides large-scale events like fires, landslides or windthrows, small-scale canopy gaps resulting from the mortality of a single tree or a group of trees represent a distinct structure within a stand. Although the role of canopy gaps is well recognized in tropical ecosystems, the effect of small-scale openings on species richness, diversity and abundance has not been satisfactorily addressed in temperate forests. A specific example of a canopy gap is the bark beetle infestation spot, that is, a small group of trees that have died as a result of insect activity. We studied the effect of canopy gaps on the breeding bird assemblage in old-growth coniferous forests in the Tatra Mts. and Gorce Mts. (Carpathians, S Poland). Our hypothesis was that the gaps and the nearby closed-canopy forest would differ in species richness, diversity and relative abundance. We censused the breeding bird assemblages in 50 such gaps (median size 0.85 ha, quartile range 0.30–2.34 ha, range 0.03–10.0 ha) and 50 nearby closed-canopy reference plots using point counts. Almost 25{\%} more bird species were recorded in the gaps than in the closed-canopy forest, and species richness correlated positively with the number of snags. The number of individual birds recorded in the gaps was 40{\%} higher than in the closed-canopy forest and correlated positively with the number of fallen logs. Gap size was not correlated with the richness, diversity or relative abundance of species. Our results show that canopy gaps resulting from bark beetle outbreaks increase species richness, diversity and abundance by providing suitable habitats for cavity-nesting, ground-nesting and insectivorous birds. We suggest that by increasing habitat heterogeneity and enhancing food resources, even relatively small-scale canopy gaps improve the overall biodiversity of coniferous forests.},

abstract = {Questions: Uncertainty in detecting disturbance histories has long been ignored in dendrochronological studies in forest ecosystems. Our goal was to characterize this uncertainty in relation to the key parameters of forest ecosystems and sample size. In addition, we aimed to provide a method to define uncertainty bounds in specific forest ecosystems with known parameters, and to provide a required (conservative) minimal sample size to achieve a pre-defined level of uncertainty if no actual key forest parameters are known. Location: Training data were collected from {\v{Z}}of{\'{i}}nsk{\'{y}} Prales (48°40'N, 14°42'E, 735-830. m a.s.l., granite, Czech Republic). Methods: We used probability theory and expressed uncertainty as the length (the difference between the upper and lower bounds) of the 95{\%} confidence interval. We studied the uncertainty of (i) the initial growth of trees - if they originated under canopy or in a gap, and (ii) the responses to disturbance events during subsequent growth - on the basis of release detection in the radial growth of trees. These two variables provide different information, which together give a picture of the disturbance history. While initial growth date the existence of a gap in a given decade (recent as well as older gaps are included), release demonstrates the moment of a disturbance event. Results: With the help of general mathematical deduction, we have obtained results valid across vegetation types. The length of a confidence interval depends on the sample size, proportion of released trees in a population, as well as on the variability of tree layer features (e.g., crown area of suppressed and released trees). Conclusions: Most studies to date have evaluated the initial growth of trees with higher uncertainty than for canopy disturbed area. The length of the 95{\%} confidence interval for detecting initial growth has been rarely shorter than 0.1 (error. ±. 5{\%}) and has mostly been much longer. To reach 95{\%} confidence interval length of 0.1 (error. ±. 5{\%}) when detecting the canopy disturbed area, at least 485 tree cores should be evaluated in studied time period, while to reach a 0.05 interval length (error. ±. 2.5{\%}) at least 1925 tree cores are required. Our approach can be used to find the required sample size in each specific forest ecosystem to achieve pre-defined levels of uncertainty while detecting disturbance history.},

abstract = {Landscape pattern indicators or 'metrics' provide simple measures of landscape structure that can be easily calculated with readily available data and software. Unfortunately, the ecological relevance of many metrics (i.e. the relationship between metric values and the real-world ecological processes that they are meant to serve as proxies for) is often unproven and questionable, and concerns are regularly voiced that such metrics fail to capture important aspects of landscape function. In this paper, I provide a review of landscape measures that may better link landscape pattern and function, ranging from approaches that extend existing metrics by incorporating a more functional component (e.g. core area measures, least cost distances) to those rooted in graph, network, and electrical circuit theory. While more 'functional' approaches are becoming increasingly popular, the selection of appropriate landscape metrics in many applications involves tradeoffs regarding data requirements, ease of calculation, functional basis, and simplicity of interpretation by a range of specialist and non-specialist stakeholders. Regardless, there continues to be a need for landscape metrics because they are seen by many land managers and stakeholders as simple, intuitive tools for assessing and monitoring changes in landscape pattern and, by extension, the effects on underlying ecological processes. Future needs include: (1) the development of more user-friendly landscape analysis software that can simplify graph-based analyses and visualization; and (2) studies that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, including the potential limitations and biases in graph and network-based measures.},

abstract = {Quantifying landscape characteristics and linking them to ecological processes is one of the central goals of landscape ecology. Landscape metrics are a widely used tool for the analysis of patch-based, discrete land-cover classes. Existing software to calculate landscape metrics has several constraints, such as being limited to a single platform, not being open-source or involving a complicated integration into large workflows. We present landscapemetrics, an open-source R package that overcomes many constraints of existing landscape metric software. The package includes an extensive collection of commonly used landscape metrics in a tidy workflow. To facilitate the integration into large workflows, landscapemetrics is based on a well-established spatial framework in R. This allows pre-processing of land-cover maps or further statistical analysis without importing and exporting the data from and to different software environments. Additionally, the package provides many utility functions to visualize, extract, and sample landscape metrics. Lastly, we provide building-blocks to motivate the development and integration of new metrics in the future. We demonstrate the usage and advantages of landscapemetrics by analysing the influence of different sampling schemes on the estimation of landscape metrics. In so doing, we demonstrate the many advantages of the package, especially its easy integration into large workflows. These new developments should help with the integration of landscape analysis in ecological research, given that ecologists are increasingly using R for the statistical analysis, modelling and visualization of spatial data.},

abstract = {Many factors have been proposed to affect biodiversity patterns across landscapes, including patch area, patch isolation, edge distances, and matrix quality, but existing models emphasize only one or two of these factors at a time. Here we introduce a synthetic but simple individual-based model that generates realistic patterns of species richness and density as a function of landscape structure. In this model, we simulated the stochastic placement of home ranges in landscapes, thus combining features of existing random placement and mid-domain effect models. As such, the model allows investigation of whether and how geometric constraints on home range placement of individuals scale up to affect species abundance and richness in landscapes. The model encompassed a gradient of possible landscapes, from a strictly homogeneous landscape to an archipelago of discrete patches. The model incorporated only variation in home range size of individuals of different species, with a simple suitability index that controlled home range spread into areas of habitat and areas of inter-habitat matrix. Demographic details of birth, death, and migration, as well as effects of species interactions were not included. Nevertheless, this simple model generated realistic patterns of biodiversity, including species-area curves and increases in diversity and abundance with decreasing isolation and increasing distance from patch edges. Species-area slopes (z values) generated by the model fell within the range observed in empirical studies on both true islands and habitat patches. Isolation and edge effects were stronger when the matrix was unsuitable, and became progressively weaker as matrix suitability increased, again in accordance with many empirical studies. When applied to a real data set on the abundance of 20 small mammal species sampled in forest patches in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, the model predicted increases in abundance and richness with increasing patch size, consistent with the general pattern observed with field data. The ability of this simple model to reproduce realistic qualitative patterns of biodiversity suggests that such patterns may be driven, at least in part, by geometric constraints acting on the placement of individual ranges, which ultimately affect biodiversity patterns at the landscape level.},

abstract = {Timber harvesting, and especially clear-cutting followed by soil scarification, has altered boreal forest ecosystems in important ways. For example, loss of decaying wood in many parts of boreal forests has reduced habitats for saproxylic species. Several methods have recently been introduced, however, to reduce the negative impacts of forestry on the natural biota. Use of controlled burning and green-tree retention in restoration and management of forests is growing rapidly, especially in Fennoscandia, but the effects of these measures on forest biota remain hypothetical. We performed a large-scale field experiment to study impacts of burning and green-tree retention on beetles in the Scots pine dominated forests of Eastern Finland. The factorial study design included a total of 24 sites (3-5 ha each), with three tree retention levels (0, 10 and 50 m3/ha) and uncut controls. Twelve of the 24 sites were burned. Each treatment combination was replicated three times. Beetles were sampled with window traps before and after the treatments in 2000 and 2001 to study short-term impacts of treatments on beetle assemblages. The data consisted of 34,175 beetle individuals, representing 740 species. The assemblages were greatly affected by the treatments, especially on the burned sites, while on the unburned sites higher tree retention level maintained assemblages closer to the pre-treatment structure. In general, the number of species increased with harvesting and burning. Burning had a significant effect on number of red-listed species, whereas harvesting intensity affected saproxylic, non-saproxylic and red-listed species. The numbers of individuals of red-listed and rare saproxylic species increased more on the burned than on the unburned sites. The results show that living conditions of many declined forest species, in particular saproxylics, can be enhanced in commercial forests by increasing the number of retained trees and by controlled burning. At least close to source areas not only strictly pyrophilous species but also many other rare and threatened species seem to be able to locate new resources quite effectively. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting trajectories of vegetation development drive the biomass and species composition of terrestrial ecosystems. Forest dynamics are changing because of anthropogenic-driven exacerbation of chronic drivers, such as rising temperature and CO 2 , and increasing transient disturbances, including wildfire, drought, windthrow, biotic attack, and land-use change. There are widespread observations of increasing tree mortality due to changing climate and land use, as well as observations of growth stimulation of younger forests due to CO 2 fertilization. These antagonistic processes are co-occurring globally, leaving the fate of future forests uncertain.

abstract = {Mountain forests are at particular risk of climate change impacts due to their temperature limitation and high exposure to warming. At the same time, their complex topography may help to buffer the effects of climate change and create climate refugia. Whether climate change can lead to critical transitions of mountain forest ecosystems and whether such transitions are reversible remains incompletely understood. We investigated the resilience of forest composition and size structure to climate change, focusing on a mountain forest landscape in the Eastern Alps. Using the individual‐based forest landscape model iLand we simulated ecosystem responses to a wide range of climatic changes (up to a 6°C increase in mean annual temperature and a 30 {\%} reduction in mean annual precipitation), testing for tipping points in vegetation size structure and composition under different topography scenarios. We found that at warming levels above +2°C a threshold was crossed, with the system tipping into an alternative state. The system shifted from a conifer‐dominated landscape characterized by large trees to a landscape dominated by smaller, predominantly broadleaved trees. Topographic complexity moderated climate change impacts, smoothing and delaying the transitions between alternative vegetation states. We subsequently reversed the simulated climate forcing to assess the ability of the landscape to recover from climate change impacts. The forest landscape showed hysteresis, particularly in scenarios with lower precipitation. At the same mean annual temperature, equilibrium vegetation size structure and species composition differed between warming and cooling trajectories. Here we show that even moderate warming corresponding to current policy targets could result in critical transitions of forest ecosystems and highlight the importance of topographic complexity as a buffering agent. Furthermore, our results show that overshooting ambitious climate mitigation targets could be dangerous, as ecological impacts can be irreversible at millennial time scales once a tipping point has been crossed.},

abstract = {A key aspect when optimizing strategic and long-term forest management policies is the temporal aggregation utilizing time periods of a specific length. As the length of the time periods influence both the problem size and the possible interaction of the management policy with the state of the forest, it implicitly has a major influence on the feasibility of computing the optimal management policy and the quality of the resulting management policy. The objective of this study was twofold: (i) to evaluate the value of considering the risk of wind damage in large-scale strategic forestry management policies, (ii) to investigate the influence of the length of the time periods on the value of considering the risk of wind damage in the management policy. The analysis was executed utilizing a graph-based Markov decision process model capable of considering stochastic wind damage event, and a case study utilizing a forest estate consisting of 1200 ha of forestry, divided into 623 stands. Twenty-, ten-, and five-year-long time periods were utilized to evaluate the influence of the length of the time periods, while the value of considering the risk of wind damage in the management of the estate was evaluated by optimizing and evaluating long-term management policies recognizing and not recognizing the risk of wind damage. Results show that the value of considering the risk of wind damage was small for the whole estate. The expected net present value of the estate increased by ≤ 2{\%} by managing the estate according to the risk of wind damage. Furthermore, while the length of the time periods had a small influence on the scale of the entire estate, it had a larger influence on the scale of a smaller subset of stands in the estate. For the whole estate, the value of considering the risk of wind damage varied with ≤ 1.5{\%} depending on the length of the time periods. While for a selected subset of stands, the value of considering the risk of wind damage varied with ≤ 6.5{\%} depending on the length of the time periods.},

abstract = {Landscape ecology is a broad field in a patchwork of related disciplines. Giving landscape ecology a definition and delimiting it from related research areas is both a challenge and a necessity. Past endeavors have focused on expert opinions, analyses of published papers, and conference proceedings. We used a mix of all three, including a unique keyword analysis in two leading landscape-related journals, to highlight latest developments in landscape ecology between 2010 and 2013. Our analysis confirms the key topics of Wu (Landscape Ecol 28(1):1-11, 2013), and suggests that of those connectivity is dominating in terms of research output. However, we also found evidence that the borders of the journal Landscape Ecology are fuzzier than sketched in recent publications. There is a large overlap with the journal Landscape and Urban Planning, and in general a growing weight of conservation, landscape management, and planning related issues in the landscape ecology community. We conclude by encouraging the continued inclusion and strengthening of socio-ecological hot topics such as urban studies and landscape human interactions in landscape ecological studies and subsequently in the journal landscape ecology.},

Nonetheless, a review of international biodiversity and sustainability policies shows that the majority advocate economic growth. Since improvements in resource use efficiency have so far not allowed for absolute global reductions in resource use and pollution, we question the support for economic growth in these policies, where inadequate attention is paid to the question of how growth can be decoupled from biodiversity loss. Drawing on the literature about alternatives to economic growth, we explore this contradiction and suggest ways forward to halt global biodiversity decline. These include policy proposals to move beyond the growth paradigm while enhancing overall prosperity, which can be implemented by combining top-down and bottom-up governance across scales. Finally, we call the attention of researchers and policy makers to two immediate steps: acknowledge the conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation in future policies; and explore socioeconomic trajectories beyond economic growth in the next generation of biodiversity scenarios.},

abstract = {There is often need to measure aggregation levels of spatial patterns within a single map class in landscape ecological studies. The contagion index (CI), shape index (SI), and probability of adjacency of the same class (Qi), all have certain limits when measuring aggregation of spatial patterns. We have developed an aggregation index (AI) that is class specific and independent of landscape composition. AI assumes that a class with the highest level of aggregation (AI = 1) is comprised of pixels sharing the most possible edges. A class whose pixels share no edges (completely disaggregated) has the lowest level of aggregation (AI = 0). AI is similar to SI and Qi, but it calculates aggregation more precisely than the latter two. We have evaluated the performance of AI under varied levels of (1) aggregation, (2) number of patches, (3) spatial resolutions, and (4) real species distribution maps at various spatial scales. AI was able to produce reasonable results under all these circumstances. Since it is class specific, it is more precise than CI, which measures overall landscape aggregation. Thus, AI provides a quantitative basis to correlate the spatial pattern of a class with a specific process. Since AI is a ratio variable, map units do not affect the calculation. It can be compared between classes from the same or different landscapes, or even the same classes from the same landscape under different resolutions.},

abstract = {Forests play an important role, contributing to human health and well-being as environments for recreation and rehabilitation. Stress has become a significant problem in modern societies, and the importance of forests as environments for stress relief has been recognized in recent years. To maintain and create forests for rehabilitation, consideration of their rehabilitation value needs to be incorporated into forest management planning and to do this, we need to define and quantify the characteristics of good rehabilitation forests. This study presents an approach for including rehabilitation value as an aspect of forest management planning. This approach is applied to three case study areas in northern, middle and southern Sweden to identify trade-offs between maintaining high wood production while creating forest areas suitable for rehabilitation from stress-related diseases. The results show that quite large areas of rehabilitation forest (10–15 {\%} of total forest area) can be maintained at a relatively small loss in economic net present value (NPV) of wood production (ca 2 {\%} of maximum NPV). When using the rehabilitation value indicator defined in this study, age and spatial variables (distance to roads and water) seem to be the most limiting factors.},

The method complements previous work by extending applicability beyond the Gaussian case, while considering tests of zero effect rather than testing the parametric hypothesis given by the null space of the component's smoothing penalty. The proposed p-values are routine and efficient to compute from a fitted model, without requiring extra model fits or null distribution simulation.},

If the errors indeed show autocorrelational structure, evaluation of the significance of predictors in the model becomes problematic due to potential anti-conservatism of p-values. This paper illustrates two tools offered by Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) (Lin and Zhang, 1999; Wood, 2006, 2011, 2013) for dealing with autocorrelated errors, as implemented in the current version of the fourth author's mgcv package (1.8.9): the possibility to specify an ar(1) error model for Gaussian models, and the possibility of using factor smooths for random-effect factors such as subject and item. These factor smooths are set up to have the same smoothing parameters, and are penalized to yield the non-linear equivalent of random intercepts and random slopes in the classical linear framework. Three case studies illustrate these issues.},

Unlike molecules or plots of barley, subjects in psycholinguistic experiments are intelligent beings that depend for their survival on constant adaptation to their environment, including the environment of an experiment. Three data sets illustrate that the human factor may interact with predictors of interest, both factorial and metric.

The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse.

However, productivity and disturbances are intrinsically linked because 1) disturbances directly affect forest productivity (e.g. via a reduction in leaf area, growing stock or resource-use efficiency), and 2) disturbance susceptibility is often coupled to a certain development phase of the forest with productivity determining the time a forest is in this specific phase of susceptibility. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of forest productivity changes in different forest regions in Europe under climate change, and partition these changes into effects induced by climate change alone and by climate change and disturbances. We present projections of climate change impacts on forest productivity from state-of-the-art forest models that dynamically simulate forest productivity and the effects of the main European disturbance agents (fire, storm, insects), driven by the same climate scenario in seven forest case studies along a large climatic gradient throughout Europe. Our study shows that, in most cases, including disturbances in the simulations exaggerate ongoing productivity declines or cancel out productivity gains in response OPEN ACCESS RECEIVED to climate change. In fewer cases, disturbances also increase productivity or buffer climate-change induced productivity losses, e.g. because low severity fires can alleviate resource competition and increase fertilization. Even though our results cannot simply be extrapolated to other types of forests and disturbances, we argue that it is necessary to interpret climate change-induced productivity and disturbance changes jointly to capture the full range of climate change impacts on forests and to plan adaptation measures.},

However, two thousand forest-associated species remain on Sweden's red-list, and Sweden's 2020 goals for sustainable forests are not being met. We argue that ongoing changes in the production forest matrix require more consideration, and that multi-scale conservation must be adapted to, and integrated with, production forest development. To make this case, we summarize trends in habitat provision by Sweden's protected and production forests, and the variety of ways silviculture can affect biodiversity. We discuss how different forestry trajectories affect the type and extent of conservation approaches needed to secure biodiversity, and suggest leverage points for aiding the adoption of diversified silviculture. Sweden's long-term experience with multi-scale conservation and intensive forestry provides insights for other countries trying to conserve species within production landscapes.},

abstract = {Wildfires, insect outbreaks, and windstorms are increasingly common forest disturbances. Post-disturbance management often involves salvage logging, i.e., the felling and removal of the affected trees; however, this practice may represent an additional disturbance with effects on ecosystem processes and services. We developed a systematic map to provide an overview of the primary studies on this topic and created a database with information on the characteristics of the retrieved publications, including information on stands, disturbance, intervention, measured outcomes, and study design. Of 4341 retrieved publications , 90 were retained in the systematic map. These publications represented 49 studies, predominantly from North America and Europe. Salvage logging after wildfire was addressed more frequently than after insect outbreaks or windstorms. Most studies addressed logging after a single disturbance event, and replication of salvaged stands rarely exceeded 10. The most frequent response variables were tree regeneration, ground cover, and deadwood characteristics. This document aims to help managers find the most relevant primary studies on the ecological effects of salvage logging. It also aims to identify and discuss clusters and gaps in the body of evidence, relevant for scientists who aim to synthesize previous work or identify questions for future studies.

abstract = {As a mountainous and forested country (40.6{\%} forest cover) in central Europe, Slovakia has a large variety of vegetation zones, forest types, and a rich diversity of forest tree species. The most important tree species are beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.), oak species (Quercus sp.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), poplars and willows (Populus L. sp., Salix L. sp.), and other hardwood broadleaves. Sources of pollution in the country and emissions from neighbouring countries have resulted in a heavily polluted environment in some regions. Forest health monitoring data on environmental pollution from 1987 to 1994 that use forest ecosystem stability as the ecological criterion indicate that forest health in Slovakia has been adversely affected by air pollution. Average defoliation varies from 26 to 30{\%} for all species. Defoliation for coniferous species is 27 to 35{\%} and for broadleaves 19 to 27{\%}. However, defoliation and foliage discoloration of trees, especially of conifers, have been reduced in recent years. These trends may be related to changes in the economy in central European countries in which the decrease of industrial activity has resulted in the decrease of pollution load. In contrary, high percentage of salvage cut (about 60{\%} of the total annual cut) indicates serious ecological instability and impaired health status of Slovakian forests.},

abstract = {The tree diameter distribution was used to characterize the impact of forest disturbances and the ecosystem dynamics during the process of regeneration in the absence of any management 44 years after the event. In addition, the impact of salvage logging after windthrow remains unknown, especially on long-term responses. In this study, comparisons were made between the “unsalvaged” and “salvaged” post-storm management scenarios. The study was conducted in Slitere Natural Park in the Northwest part of Latvia, where large-scale windthrow occurred on November 2, 1969. The three-parameter Weibull function was used to describe the diameter distribution of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands formed after large-scale wind storm in two site types (on fertile mineral soils: with normal moisture regime (fresh)—Oxalidosa—and with periodic excess water (wet)—Myrtilloso-sphagnosa) and where salvage logging was or was not carried out (management scenarios). The naturally regenerated stands remained Norway spruce dominated and were independent of the post-storm management scenarios; still, they were significantly affected by a forest type. The three-parameter Weibull distribution function suited well to actual diameter distributions of the sample plots. Diameter distributions significantly differed between the forest types: In Myrtilloso-sphagnosa (wet) forest stands, it was a negative exponential and in Oxalidosa (fresh) stands unimodal and positively skewed. We did not detect distribution differences caused by salvage after a large-scale disturbance, indicating that other factors (like ecological importance of deadwood, a risk of insect outbreaks to neighboring areas, etc.) need to be considered, when deciding on the post-storm management.},

abstract = {Many studies have reported increased multi-functionality and financial profits due to a shift from even-to uneven-aged forest management. However, little is known (from long-term experiences or predictions) how alternative management systems could affect national-scale wood production and carbon storage, if adopted over very large areas. We analysed these effects using an area-based framework, in which multiple Markov chain models were used to simulate the development of forests according to different management systems. Classification of forests to wood availability categories was used to determine the system to be applied. We enhanced the framework to allow shifts between management systems that correspond to enforced or voluntary changes in forest use. Simulations of extensive shifts from conventional even-aged management to alternative silvicultural systems revealed interesting developmental patterns that cannot be directly deduced from studies that upscale from smaller areas. Our results show that the amount of carbon stored by Finnish forests can be increased by applying less intensive management systems, although this has trade-offs in terms of harvests and associated financial costs. The level of trade-offs differed depending on the type of forest that shifted between management systems and whether areas were also assumed to be completely set aside from forestry. These differences were further pronounced if the desired harvest levels and their allocation changed along with the management system. If the studied attributes were considered at the same relative scale and with equal weighting, the extensive shifts to alternative management systems exhibited the strongest impact on harvesting costs.},

abstract = {Background: Forest ecosystems are increasingly seen as multi-functional production systems, which should provide, besides timber and economic benefits, also other ecosystem services related to biological diversity, recreational uses and environmental functions of forests. This study analyzed the performance of even-aged rotation forest management (RFM), continuous cover forestry (CCF) and any-aged forestry (AAF) in the production of ecosystem services. AAF allows both even-aged and uneven-aged management schedules. The ecosystem services included in the analyses were net present value, volume of harvested timber, cowberry and bilberry yields, scenic value of the forest, carbon balance and suitability of the forest to Siberian jay. Methods: Data envelopment analysis was used to derive numerical efficiency ratios for the three management systems. Efficiency ratio is the sum of weighted outputs (ecosystem services) divided by the sum of weighted inputs. The linear programing model proposed by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes was used to derive the weights for calculating efficiency scores for the silvicultural systems.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Optimal any-aged management problems for mixed-species stands have been solved for the first time. Problem formulation calls for periodic planting and harvesting controls to be applied without constraints on the stand age or size structure over time; classical definitions of both even- and uneven-aged management are, thus, subsets of this general any-aged management definition. The solution technique is a derivative-free, coordinate-search process called the method of Hooke and Jeeves. The optimizer incorporates without modification the Stand Prognosis Model, a single-tree simulator that is used extensively in the western United States. This paper focuses on sensitivity analysis and performance of the optimizer on problems with both short and long time horizons and with different definitions of the harvest controls. Superior harvest regimes are found by defining harvest controls with relatively wide diameter-class boundaries and with broad species groups. In all cases examined, there is variability in present value and harvest pattern associated with the choice of the starting point for the optimizer. The cause of these multiple optima is a nonconvex and discontinuous response surface produced by the single-tree simulator. This points out the need to examine the results from several random starts before making conclusions about optimal timber harvesting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In the following paper, we use robust optimization to calculate portfolios of Chilean forest stands which minimize the greatest underperformance among all considered ecosystem services (ES) and biodiversity. Forest experts were asked to score the six most important ES indicators and biodiversity for forest stands with either exotic or native tree species. Average scores and their variation were used to form an optimal forest portfolio (proportions of the five stand types). Quantitative indicators of ES were used to calculate the reference portfolio. Portfolios based on expert opinions (49{\%} Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 51{\%} native Nothofagus and mixed Pseudotsuga) did not differ significantly from portfolios based on quantitative indicators (51{\%} Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 49{\%} Nothofagus, mixed Pseudotsuga and Acacia). Both portfolios offer good protection against low achievement levels and prevent the degradation of important ES and biodiversity, while pure stands showed low achievement levels for specific ES. We conclude that integrating expert knowledge into forest planning may well support considering ES and biodiversity. Forest owners in the Mediterranean region of Chile should be encouraged to integrate native Nothofagus species into their forest portfolios to better provide for multiple ES and the conservation of biodiversity.},

abstract = {For the past few decades, the integration of biodiversity conservation into forest management has constituted an important challenge, since the new forest management models should make conservation objectives compatible with production issues. In many countries, timber production is no longer the main ecosystem service provided, thus other aspects such as biodiversity conservation are taken into account. One of the strategies developed to do so is to define, at the stand level, areas where final cuttings are not allowed. These areas can be found dispersed or aggregated (comprised of multiple stands) throughout the forest, helping to maintain a percentage of mature forest that fulfils conservation goals. In this study, we have developed a strategic forest planning model that allows us to integrate several retention systems compared to the business-as-usual treatment traditionally used. Production, technical and environmental criteria have been considered in order to analyse the degree of conflict between them by designing a pay-off matrix. Using multicriteria techniques conflicting objectives were assessed, and decision makers' interactions have been introduced. These interactions range from criteria selection to the allocation of preferential weights to each criterion until the best solution among a set of possible alternatives is identified. The presented analytical procedure is based on the extended goal programming method applied in an exemplary forest in central Spain. Our results show that the proposed methodology allows deriving solutions that are acceptable for decision makers while estimating physical and economic opportunity costs of conservation measures in timber volume and Euros respectively.},

abstract = {Three ideal point-based multi-criteria decision methods (MCDM), i.e., iterative ideal point thresholding (IIPT), compromise programming (CP) and a newly-proposed CP variant, called balanced compromise programming (BCP), were applied to the Tabacay catchment in Ecuador with the aim of finding a distribution of land use types (LUT) that optimizes regional land performance. This performance was expressed in terms of several conflicting on-site ecosystem services (ESS), namely water conservation, soil protection, carbon storage and monetary income. IIPT selects the best performing LUT on a per-land unit basis, that is the assignment of a LUT to a land unit is completely independent with respect to other land units. CP and BCP, on the other hand, aim at optimizing the integrated regional performance. These methods produce a LUT distribution that is as close as possible to the absolute optimal performance that would be achieved when conflict among ESS is not considered. In general, similar results were obtained with CP and BCP. This was not the case when the results produced by these two methods were contrasted with IIPT. For most ESS under consideration, CP and BCP produced balanced results that were closer to the absolute optimal values when compared to IIPT. We conclude from our results that, when optimization of land performance at a regional scale is at stake, CP-derived models emerge as the preferable option over IIPT, especially when balanced solutions are a requirement.

abstract = {Wind damage causes significant economic losses in boreal forests and elsewhere. Climate change may increase the occurrence of strong storms and decrease tree anchorage, making wind risk management an important aspect of future forest management. This study modeled the probability of wind throw as a function of thinning type, time since previous cutting, characteristics of the subject tree and stand, and shelter provided by adjacent upwind stands. The data were collected from two long-term silvicultural experiments, which experienced strong storm events during the past few years. The analyses showed that the most risky cutting was shelterwood cut, followed by even-aged silviculture characterized by repeated low thinnings. Cuttings where the probability of wind throw was lowest were selective high thinnings of uneven-sized stands, and dimension cutting. Very dense un-thinned stands had very low probability of wind damage. Increasing tree size, increasing height/diameter ratio, decreasing stand basal area, and decreasing basal area of adjacent upwind stands increased the probability of wind throw. Stands were most vulnerable to wind damage immediately after thinning. Uneven-sized stand structure was associated with low probability of wind throw. It was concluded that continuous cover management decreases wind damage, as compared to even-aged management.},

Treatment of the stands according to the management policy specified by the GMDP model increased the expected net present value (NPV) of the whole forest only slightly, less than 2{\%}, under different wind-risk assumptions. Most of the stands were managed in the same manner as when the risk of wind damage was not considered.

However, the interactions between ecosystem service provision, disturbance and landscape composition are poorly understood. Here we present a novel approach to include uncertainty in the optimization of land allocation for improving the provision of multiple ecosystem services. We refer to the rehabilitation of abandoned agricultural lands in Ecuador including two types of both afforestation and pasture rehabilitation, together with a succession option. Our results show that high compositional landscape diversity supports multiple ecosystem services (multifunction effect). This implicitly provides a buffer against uncertainty. Our work shows that active integration of uncertainty is only important when optimizing single or highly correlated ecosystem services and that the multifunction effect on landscape diversity is stronger than the uncertainty effect.

abstract = {Humans require multiple services from ecosystems, but it is largely unknown whether trade-offs between ecosystem functions prevent the realisation of high ecosystem multifunctionality across spatial scales. Here, we combined a comprehensive dataset (28 ecosystem functions measured on 209 forest plots) with a forest inventory dataset (105,316 plots) to extrapolate and map relationships between various ecosystem multifunctionality measures across Europe. These multifunctionality measures reflected different management objectives, related to timber production, climate regulation and biodiversity conservation/recreation. We found that trade-offs among them were rare across Europe, at both local and continental scales. This suggests a high potential for ‘win-win' forest management strategies, where overall multifunctionality is maximised. However, across sites, multifunctionality was on average 45.8-49.8{\%} below maximum levels and not necessarily highest in protected areas. Therefore, using one of the most comprehensive assessments so far, our study suggests a high but largely unrealised potential for management to promote multifunctional forests. },

abstract = {Ips amitinus arrived in Northern Europe at the beginning of 1900s, although its recent expansions to the northernmost conifers have been rapid. Analyses of recent records, MaxEnt models and regional population size estimates are used to discuss its peculiar range shifts and potential as a forest pest in Northern Europe. Ips amitinus was probably absent in northern glacial refugia for Norway spruce in the Russian plain and northward expansions from its glacial refugia in the Central European mountains may have been slowed down by: (i) ecological barriers of post-glacial dry plains and bogs in Central Europe; (ii) heavy utilization of conifers; and (iii) Allee effects as a result of fragmented forests and an unfavourable climate for a cold-adapted species in the continental lowlands. MaxEnt models predict that I. amitinus may become widespread in the Northern European forests, whereas its populations in the southernmost mountain ranges of Europe may decline in the future. The population levels of I. amitinus in recently invaded northern areas are still lower than those in core areas of Central Europe, although the population development in Central Europe indicates that future bark beetle outbreak periods may boost the I. amitinus populations in Northern Europe as well.},

abstract = {Windfelled Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees play a crucial role in triggering large-scale outbreaks of the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. Outbreak management therefore strives to remove windfelled trees to reduce the risk of outbreaks, a measure referred to as sanitation logging (SL). Although this practice has been traditionally applied, its efficiency in preventing outbreaks remains poorly understood. We used the landscape simulation model iLand to investigate the effects of different spatial configurations and intensities of SL of windfelled trees on the subsequent disturbance by bark beetles. We studied differences between SL applied evenly across the landscape, focused on the vicinity of roads (scenario of limited logging resources) and concentrated in a contiguous block (scenario of spatially diversified management objectives). We focused on a 16 050 ha forest landscape in Central Europe. The removal of {\textgreater}80{\%} of all windfelled trees is required to substantially reduce bark beetle disturbances. Focusing SL on the vicinity of roads created a “fire break effect” on bark beetle spread, and was moderately efficient in reducing landscape-scale bark beetle disturbance. Block treatments substantially reduced outbreaks in treated areas. Leaving parts of the landscape untreated (e.g., conservation areas) had no significant amplifying effect on outbreaks in managed areas. Climate change increased bark beetle disturbances and reduced the effect of SL. Our results suggest that past outbreak management methods will not be sufficient to counteract climate-mediated increases in bark beetle disturbance.},

abstract = {Retention forestry, in which trees and tree patches are set aside at harvest to promote biodiversity, has been proven to have positive effects on biodiversity at the stand-level across different taxa. However, the effectiveness of retention approaches with regard to landscape composition remains unexplored. We linked the effect sizes from two meta-analyses (31 case studies and 1050 comparisons from boreal and temperate regions), which quantified the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation as a result of retention practices, with the stand property of retention level (the percentage of trees retained after logging) and with Landsat-retrieved landscape data on forest cover and spatial configurations at three spatial scales (1, 3, and 5 km radii). We found that, in addition to the fundamental importance of tree retention as a local-scale implementation for conservation, landscape properties were important in models to predict biodiversity responses. The effect sizes for species richness decreased with increasing patch contiguity within the landscapes at all spatial scales. Similar results were observed for abundance responses at the largest spatial scale. These results suggest that biodiversity responses to tree retention may be weaker in less fragmented landscapes, which is in agreement with theoretical and empirical findings from agricultural landscapes (‘the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis'). The benefits of retention levels within a stand (percentage of trees retained) varied amongst species with different habitat requirements (forest-dependent, open habitat, and generalist species). Whilst this stand-level property was often an important determinant of biodiversity responses, models that included landscape properties as explanatory variables always performed better than those that were only based on the retention levels for all species groups. Thus, within-stand habitat conditions and landscape configurations likely have synergetic influences on biodiversity responses. Synthesis and applications. In addition to the importance of stand-level properties, such as the action of retention harvesting itself and the number of trees retained, conditions in the surrounding landscape can simultaneously affect biodiversity in stands that are managed under retention forestry. Our study suggests that retention patches are particularly important in moderately fragmented landscapes. Retention practices could be less important in previously unlogged and less fragmented landscapes, where setting aside large reserves is a conservation priority. For highly fragmented landscapes, different actions of forest restoration, which are not limited to set-aside actions during logging, would be important. Our study emphasizes that carefully planned conservation schemes with a large-scale perspective, as well as local-scale actions, such as retention forestry, are critical for effective forest management and conservation planning.},

Our results indicate that 27{\%} of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production.

Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined.

abstract = {Models predicting forest stand wind-firmness are usually based on the calculation of a critical wind speed above which the mean tree of a stand is broken or uprooted. This approach is well adapted to regular stands, but in heterogeneous stands, not all the trees are necessarily damaged at the same time. Models used to analyse the distribution of damage within a population of trees can be a good alternative. In this perspective we developed FOREOLE, an individual-based mechanical model of tree response to wind. FOREOLE is based on a numerical description of tree structure allowing both wind and self-weight loads to be calculated at every level of the stem, as well as the bending moment at the tree base and mechanical stresses along the stem. We use a static approach to model wind forces in which the turbulent aspect of wind is taken into account through a gust factor. Stem breakage or uprooting is then predicted from comparisons to failure criteria, i.e. critical bending moment and critical compressive stress, respectively. Implemented in the software called CAPSIS, FOREOLE is compatible with a model of coniferous forest stand dynamics and allows wind-firmness to be simulated both in measured and virtual populations of trees. On individual trees, FOREOLE provided predictions of critical wind speed comparable to the existing models known as GALES and HWIND, despite differences in the method used to describe tree shape and to solve mechanics. These predictions appeared particularly sensitive to the gust factor and the drag coefficient. We then analysed the influence of stand structure, wind speed and individual tree characteristics on the type and amount of damage. From simulations in stands representing three different structures (regular, intermediate and selection stands), we showed that irregular stands experience scattered damage for a relatively wide range of wind speeds, whereas regular stands tend to collapse as a whole above a critical wind speed. Irregularity also increased the ratio between loss in volume of wood and loss in number of trees. Regarding tree characteristics, the highest and the slenderest subjects were the most sensitive, both to stem breakage and to overturning. Sensitivity to breakage was also increased by shorter crowns. In addition, statistical analysis of the simulation results also showed that wind speed remained the most significant variable in explaining wind damage. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This might be increasingly important to consider given the rising prevalence of stress-related diseases and illness absence. To make it feasible to plan for forest management strategies that take such restorative effects into account, it would seem to be important to identify the precise physical properties that contribute to the restorative qualities of forest stands. It would also be useful if forest stand data typically already collected by forest owners could be used for this purpose. In the present study, forest stands in northern, central, and southern Sweden were visited and assessed regarding their restorative potential. These assessments were analysed together with available forest stand data for each region using statistical models. Our results indicate that of the available forest stand data parameters, the most important individual indicators of forest stands' restorative qualities were tree age, tree sparsity, and tree height. Models based on these parameters explained 30-40 {\%} of the variation in restorative qualities among the evaluated stands, indicating that they can be useful in planning and modelling scenarios where restorative properties of forest stands are considered.},

abstract = {A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Machine learning Forest damage Wind risk Risk models GALES Forest planning A B S T R A C T This paper tested the ability of machine learning techniques, namely artificial neural networks and random forests, to predict the individual trees within a forest most at risk of damage in storms. Models based on these techniques were developed individually for both a small forest area containing a set of 29 permanent sample plots that were damaged in Storm Martin in December 1999, and from a much larger set of 235 forest inventory plots damaged in Storm Klaus in January 2009. Both data sets are within the Landes de Gascogne Forest in Nouvelle-Aquitaine, France. The models were tested both against the data from which they were developed, and against the data set from the other storm. For comparison with an earlier study using the same data, logistic regression models were also developed. In addition, the ability of machine learning techniques to substitute for a mechanistic wind damage risk model by training them with previous mechanistic model predictions was tested. All models were accurate at identifying whether trees would be damaged or not damaged but the random forests models were more accurate, had higher discriminatory power, and were almost totally unaffected by the removal of any individual input variable. However, if all information relating to a stand was removed the random forests model lost accuracy and discriminatory power. The other models were similarly affected by the removal of all site information but none of the models were affected by removal of all tree information, suggesting that damage in the Landes de Gascogne Forest occurs at stand scale and is not controlled by individual tree characteristics. The models developed with the large comprehensive database were also accurate in identifying damaged trees when applied to the small forest data damaged in the earlier storm. However, none of the models developed with the smaller forest data set could successfully discriminate between damaged and undamaged trees when applied across the whole landscape. All models were very successful in replicating the predictions of the mechanistic wind risk model and using them as a substitute for the mechanistic model predictions of critical wind speed did not affect the damage model results. Overall the results suggest that random forests provide a significant advantage over other statistical modelling techniques and the random forest models were found to be more robust in their predictions if all input variables were not available. In addition, the ability to replace the mechanistic wind damage model suggests that random forests could provide a powerful tool for damage risk assessment over large regions and provide rapid assessment of the impact of different management strategies or be used in the development of optimised forest management with multiple objectives and constraints including the risk of wind damage.},

abstract = {Windstorms are natural disturbance agents in forests playing a role in natural forest regeneration. In Finland, the most severe individual windstorms have commonly damaged 2-4 million m 3 of timber. In addition to financial losses caused to forest owners, windthrown trees have in many cases seriously disrupted the func-tionality of the national power grid. Communicating windstorm risks in duty forecasting is difficult. In this study, we aimed at developing windstorm impact estimates for forest damage in Finland to help the forecaster to improve communication of the risks of windstorms. We have compared the volume of forest damage caused by the most intense windstorms in Finland during the recent decade to the observed maximum inland wind gust speeds associated with the same windstorms. It was found out that the volume of forest damage follows approximately a power relation as a function of wind gust speed with a power of ∼ 10. This is a tentative estimate because of a short time series and small number of inspected windstorms. Moreover, also wind direction, location of the affected area and soil properties among other factors have an impact to the amount of damage as illustrated in our inspection. Despite the shortness of the time series, we believe that our results demonstrating the steep increase in the impacts of windstorms with an increasing windstorm intensity are valuable. However, more detailed investigations with longer time series are needed in order to more specifically communicate the windstorm risks and their impacts in boreal forests.},

abstract = {In this work, we studied the impacts of climate change on timber production and regional risks of wind-induced damage to forests in Finland. The work employed: (i) national level forest inventory data, (ii) current baseline climate (1961-1990) and changing climate scenario (FINADAPT A2, 2001-2099), (iii) a forest ecosystem model (SIMA), (iv) a mechanistic wind damage model (HWIND), and (v) currently applied forest management recommendations as a baseline. The results showed that the timber production will increase significantly towards the end of this century under the changing climate, and in a relative sense the most in Northern Finland. At the same time, the share of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) is expected to decrease, especially in southernmost Finland, mainly favoring the presence of birch (Betula spp.), but also Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), when no species preference is given in management. As a result, the proportion of forest area in the two lowest critical wind speed classes (i.e. winds of 11-14 and 14-17ms-1) will decrease in the autumn (birch without leaves) throughout Finland. However, in summertime (birch is in leaf) the proportion of forest area with such critical wind speeds will even increase in southernmost Finland. Even though, in summertime the risk of damage should be on average relatively low throughout Finland due to a lower occurrence of such wind speeds compared to the windiest time of the year (i.e. from autumn to early spring). The return period of critical wind speeds of 11-17ms-1 is today about every two years in southernmost Finland. In Northern Finland, the critical wind speeds needed for wind damage are, on average, higher due to the larger share of Scots pine and on average lower height to breast height diameter ratios of trees compared to the south. To conclude, the climate change will affect clearly the forest growth and dynamics and, thus increase the need to manage forests more often and/or heavily (e.g. thinning, final felling), which in addition to species preference, will affect the risks of damages. The consideration of the risk of wind damage is crucial especially in Southern Finland when adapting forest management to the changing climate. This is because the unfrozen soil period is expected to increase significantly in Finland, which decreases tree anchorage during the windiest time of year. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The bioeconomy has an increasing role to play in climate change mitigation and the sustainable development of 10 national economies. In a forested country, such as Finland, over 50{\%} of its current bioeconomy relies on the sustainable management and utilization of forest resources. Wind storms are a major risk that forests are exposed to and high spatial resolution analysis of the most vulnerable locations can produce risk assessment of forest management planning. Coarse spatial resolution estimates of the return levels of maximum wind speed based, e.g., on reanalysed meteorological data or climate scenarios can be downscaled to forest stand levels with the help of land cover and terrain elevation data. In this paper, we 15 examine the feasibility of the wind multiplier approach for downscaling of maximum wind speed, using 20 meter spatial resolution CORINE-land use dataset and high resolution digital elevation data. A coarse spatial resolution estimate of the 10-year return level of maximum wind speed was obtained from the ERA-Interim reanalysed data. These data were downscaled to 26 meteorological station locations to represent very diverse environments: Open Baltic Sea islands, agricultural land, forested areas, and Northern Finland treeless fells. Applying a comparison, the downscaled 10-year return levels explained 20 77{\%} of the observed variation among the stations examined. In addition, the spatial variation of wind multiplier downscaled 10-year return level wind was compared with the WAsP-model simulated wind. The heterogeneous test area was situated in Northern Finland, and it was found that the major features of the spatial variation were similar, but in the details, there were relatively large differences. However, for areas representing a typical Finnish forested landscape with no major topographic variation, both of the methods produced very similar results. Further fine-tuning of wind multipliers could improve the 25 downscaling for the locations with large topographic variation. However, the current results already indicate that the wind multiplier method offers a pragmatic and computationally feasible tool for identifying at a high spatial resolution those locations having the highest forest wind damage risks. It can also be used to provide the necessary wind climate information for wind damage risk model calculations, thus making it possible to estimate the probability of predicted threshold wind speeds for wind damage and consequently the probability (and amount) of wind damage for certain forest stand configurations. 30},

abstract = {In this study, the potential global loss of species directly associated with land use in the EU and due to trade with other regions is computed over time, in order to reveal differences in impacts between the considered alternatives of plausible bioenergy policies development in the EU. The spatially explicit study combines a life cycle analysis (LCA) for biodiversity impact assessment with a global high resolution economic land use model. Both impacts of domestic land use and impacts through imports were included for estimating the biodiversity footprint of the member states of the (EU28). The analyzed scenarios assumed similar biomass demand until 2020 but differed thereafter, from keeping the growth of demand for bioenergy constant (CONST), to a strong increase of bioenergy in line with the EU target of decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80{\%} by 2050 (EMIRED) and with the baseline (BASE) scenario falling between the other two. As a general trend, the increasing demand for biomass was found to have substantial impact on biodiversity in all scenarios, while the differences between the scenarios were found to be modest. The share caused by imports was 15{\%} of the overall biodiversity impacts detected in this study in the year 2000, and progressively increased to 24{\%} to 26{\%} in 2050, depending on the scenario. The most prominent future change in domestic land use in all scenarios was the expansion of perennial cultivations for energy. In the EMIRED scenario, there is a larger expansion of perennial cultivations and a smaller expansion of cropland in the EU than in the other two scenarios. As the biodiversity damage is smaller for land used for perennial cultivations than for cropland, this development decreases the internal biodiversity damage per unit of land. At the same time, however, the EMIRED scenario also features the largest outsourcing of damage, due to increased import of cropland products from outside the EU for satisfying the EU food demand. These two opposite effects even out each other, resulting in the total biodiversity damage for the EMIRED scenario being only slightly higher than the other two scenarios. The results of this study indicate that increasing cultivation of perennials for bioenergy and the consequent decrease in the availability of cropland for food production in the EU may lead to outsourcing of agricultural products supply to other regions. This development is associated with a leakage of biodiversity damages to species-rich and vulnerable regions outside the EU. In the case of a future increase in bioenergy demand, the combination of biomass supply from sustainable forest management in the EU, combined with imported wood pellets and cultivation of perennial energy crops, appears to be less detrimental to biodiversity than expansion of energy crops in the EU.},

abstract = {In many areas, picking wild berries constitutes an important forest commodity offering food, recreational services, and revenues. Intensified forest management has negatively affected bilberry yields. In this study, regional-level scenario analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of four approaches to the inclusion of bilberry yields on the economics, management, and resulting forest structures in North Karelia. The current approach ignoring bilberries resulted in decreasing bilberry yields and increasing younger forests. When bilberries were valued at market price (1.72 € kg−1), bilberry yields still decreased despite the fact that forest management were slightly modified to favour bilberry. Adding non-declining sustainability constraints to bilberry yields resulted in a slightly lower total net present value of timber and bilberry since forest management favoured longer rotation lengths, which increased bilberry yields. Similar effects occurred when the bilberry price was tripled to include the implicit ecosystem benefits of bilberries. When forests were managed only for bilberries (timber zero-priced), bilberry yields started to increase immediately resulting in 1.5-fold difference in 50 years as compared to timber only scenario. In conclusion, managing forests for both timber and bilberry production has rather minor effects on economics, but it can have clear positive effect on bilberry yields.},

abstract = {Limited knowledge of dispersal for most organisms hampers effective connectivity conservation in fragmented landscapes. In forest ecosystems, deadwood-dependent organisms (i.e., saproxylics) are negatively affected by forest management and degradation globally. We reviewed empirically established dispersal ecology of saproxylic insects and fungi. We focused on direct studies (e.g., mark-recapture, radiotelemetry), field experiments, and population genetic analyses. We found 2 somewhat opposite results. Based on direct methods and experiments, dispersal is limited to within a few kilometers, whereas genetic studies showed little genetic structure over tens of kilometers, which indicates long-distance dispersal. The extent of direct dispersal studies and field experiments was small and thus these studies could not have detected long-distance dispersal. Particularly for fungi, more studies at management-relevant scales (1–10 km) are needed. Genetic researchers used outdated markers, investigated few loci, and faced the inherent difficulties of inferring dispersal from genetic population structure. Although there were systematic and species-specific differences in dispersal ability (fungi are better dispersers than insects), it seems that for both groups colonization and establishment, not dispersal per se, are limiting their occurrence at management-relevant scales. Because most studies were on forest landscapes in Europe, particularly the boreal region, more data are needed from nonforested landscapes in which fragmentation effects are likely to be more pronounced. Given the potential for long-distance dispersal and the logical necessity of habitat area being a more fundamental landscape attribute than the spatial arrangement of habitat patches (i.e., connectivity sensu strict), retaining high-quality deadwood habitat is more important for saproxylic insects and fungi than explicit connectivity conservation in many cases.},

abstract = {In the future, a significant proportion of Northern forests may become intensively managed through the planting of monospecific stands of native or introduced trees, and the use of multiple silvicultural treatments such as forest fertilization. Such an intensification of management in selected parts of the landscape is suggested by different zoning models, for example the Triad approach, which is under evaluation in some regions of North America. In this study, based on Fennoscandian conditions, we predicted landscape-scale extinction risks of five hypothetical model insect species dependent on fresh dead wood from Norway spruce (Picea abies), by simulating colonizations and local extinctions in forest stands. Intensified forestry applied to 50{\%} of the spruce stands led to strongly increased extinction risks of all species during the following 150 years. For one species-the sun-exposure specialist-there were strong effects already after 50 years. The negative effects of intensive plantation forestry could be compensated for by taking greater biodiversity conservation measures in other managed forests or by setting aside more forests. This is consistent with the Triad model, which is according to our analyzes an effective way to decrease extinction risks, especially for the short-dispersing species and the species associated with closed forest. A zoning of forest land into intensive forestry, conventional forestry, and set asides may be better at combining increased timber production and maintenance of biodiversity in comparison to landscapes where all production forests are managed in the same way. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We evaluated the long-term implications from modifying rotation lengths in production forests for four forest-reliant species with different habitat requirements. By combining simulations of forest development with habitat models, and accounting both for stand and landscape scale influences, we projected habitat availability over 150 years in a large Swedish landscape, using rotation lengths which are longer (+22{\%} and +50{\%}) and shorter (−22{\%}) compared to current practices. In terms of mean habitat availability through time, species requiring older forest were affected positively by extended rotations, and negatively by shortened rotations. For example, the mean habitat area for the treecreeper Certhia familiaris (a bird preferring forest with larger trees) increased by 31{\%} when rotations were increased by 22{\%}, at a 5{\%} cost to net present value (NPV) and a 7{\%} decrease in harvested volume. Extending rotation lengths by 50{\%} provided more habitat for this species compared to a 22{\%} extension, but at a much higher marginal cost. In contrast, the beetle Hadreule elongatula, which is dependent on sun-exposed dead wood, benefited from shortened rather than prolonged rotations. Due to an uneven distribution of stand-ages within the landscape, the relative amounts of habitat provided by different rotation length scenarios for a given species were not always consistent through time during the simulation period. If implemented as a conservation measure, prolonging rotations will require long-term strategic planning to avoid future bottlenecks in habitat availability, and will need to be accompanied by complementary measures accounting for the diversity of habitats necessary for the conservation of forest biodiversity.},

The aim of this study was to compare the factors affecting forest susceptibility to storm damage between two storm types, autumn extra-tropical cyclones and thunder storms, to find out whether similar factors expose forests to damage in storms with different meteorological characteristics. We used two storm damage data sets collected after two autumn storms in November 2001 and four thunder storms in summer 2010 in Finland. The damage caused by these storms was documented after the storms on plots of the Finnish National Forest Inventory. We used generalized linear mixed models to study the probability of storm damage in different types of forest stands. Explanatory variables in the models described stand characteristics, recent forest management operations, soil type and topography. The models were able to discriminate between the damaged and non-damaged plots (AUCautumn = 0.724, AUCthunder = 0.808). The autumn storm model also had some discrimination power for predicting the storm damage in the thunder storm data set (AUCthunder2 = 0.675). These results suggest that similar factors affect stand susceptibility to storm damage in both storm types. The potential use of the models was demonstrated by using the autumn storm model to calculate damage probabilities for stand simulations and to create a forest storm damage susceptibility map for Southern Finland.},

abstract = {The increase of wood decay due to the fungal pathogen Heterobasidion annosum is expected to increase the vulnerability of tree stands to wind damage due to the decrease in tree anchorage (by wood decay in roots) and stem strength (by wood decay in stem wood). In this work, we developed a framework to simulate the effects of wood decay by Heterobasidion annosum on the vulnerability of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands to wind damage in terms of uprooting and stem breakage. We also demonstrated the model performance by using tree-and stand-level sensitivity analyses. The increase in the amount of wood decay decreased the predicted wind speeds needed for both uprooting and stem breakage of trees and increased the predicted amount of wind damage. The probability of uprooting was higher than stem breakage for infected trees, which was opposite to the findings for the healthy trees. Because of some simplifications in the modelling due to the lack of proper experimental data (e.g., effects of wood decay on strength of roots and stem in Norway spruce), our model may overestimate the risk of wind damage caused by wood decay. Therefore, further model validation is still needed based on experimental research.},

Impacts of wind on induvidual trees and forests mainly depend on the strength (or intensity) of the wind and the stability of the trees. Wind causes large-scale damage to forests and serious economical losses for the forestry sector within Europe. Therefore, knowledge of interactions between wind and trees and/or forests provides the baseline for developing adequate prevention or mitigation of the negative consequences associated with wind disturbances in forest ecosystems. Herein, we analyse the wind as an ecological and disturbance factor in forests in Europe, emphasising forests in Slovakia. Here, strong winds destroy mostly spruce dominated forests in the following regions; Orava, High and Low Tatra Mountains, Great Fatra Mountains, Pohronie, Pol'ana Mountains and Slovak Ore Mountains. Increasing volumes of timber damaged by windstorms have been documented since 1961, with the maximum damage recorded in 2004. Yearly volumes of damaged timber of approximately 2.5 mil. m3 are predicted from 2016 to 2030. This highlights the data requirement regarding wind disturbances for integrated forest protection against dangerous winds and other disturbance agents in forest ecosystems in Slovakia and other European countries.},

abstract = {Several studies estimating the effects of global environmental change on biodiversity are focused on climate change. Yet, non-climatic factors such as changes in land cover can also be of paramount importance. This may be particularly important for habitat specialists associated with human-dominated landscapes, where land cover and climate changes may be largely decoupled. Here, we tested this idea by modelling the influence of climate, landscape composition and pattern, on the predicted future (2021–2050) distributions of 21 farmland bird species in the Iberian Peninsula, using boosted regression trees and 10-km resolution presence/absence data. We also evaluated whether habitat specialist species were more affected by landscape factors than generalist species. Overall, this study showed that the contribution of current landscape composition and pattern to the performance of species distribution models (SDMs) was relatively low. However, SDMs built using either climate or climate plus landscape variables yielded very different predictions of future species range shifts and, hence, of the geographical patterns of change in species richness. Our results indicate that open habitat specialist species tend to expand their range, whereas habitat generalist species tend to retract under climate change scenarios. The effect of incorporating landscape factors were particularly marked on open habitat specialists of conservation concern, for which the expected expansion under climate change seems to be severely constrained by land cover change. Overall, results suggest that particular attention should be given to landscape change in addition to climate when modelling the impacts of environmental changes for both farmland specialist and generalist bird distributions.},

abstract = {Key message Climate change is posing a considerable challenge to foresters. The intensity of required adaptive measures and the relevance of old-growth forests as benchmark for managed forests are debated. Forest managers need to make decisions on stand treatment that are based on climatological and biological parameters with high uncertainties. We provided the conceptual basis for adaptive forest management and provide a number of case studies that reflect the options and limitations of ways of coping with climate change. The examples are derived from the experience of the authors. We conclude that only few forest types are either not strongly affected by climate change or do not require immediate adaptations of forest management. Many productive forests have stand properties that are decisively shaped by past management decisions, such as tree species composition, age distribution, rotation period, and stand structure. Maintaining these properties under the influence of climate change requires continuous and even increasing efforts of forest managers.},

abstract = {Continuing, severe outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) across western North America have resulted in widespread mortality of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). Multiple studies have used high spatial resolution satellite data to map areas of beetle kill; these studies have largely focused on mapping red canopy cover associated with recent tree mortality and have not examined mapping gray canopy cover that occurs after red needles have dropped. The work presented here examines the use of newly available GeoEye-1 data for mapping both red and gray canopy area in southeastern Wyoming lodgepole pine forest. A 0.5m spatial resolution, pan-sharpened GeoEye-1 image was used to classify areas of green, red, and gray canopy cover. Reference data were collected at twelve 500m2 field plots. Shadow-normalized green, red, and gray canopy area from classified GeoEye-1 data closely agreed with field-estimated green, red, and gray canopy area. Mean absolute error in canopy cover for the twelve sample plots was 8.3{\%} for the green class, 5.4{\%} for the red class, and 7.2{\%} for the gray class. When all twelve plots were aggregated, remotely sensed estimates of green, red, and gray cover were within 1.7{\%} of the field-estimated cover. Our results demonstrate that high spatial resolution spaceborne multispectral data are a promising tool for mapping canopy mortality caused by mountain pine beetle outbreaks. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

A novel method was used to study dispersal in the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.), under epidemic conditions (rapidly increasing population density) in the {\v{S}}umava National Park. Infested spruce logs were coated with a fine fluorescent powder and the passively marked emerging beetles were captured in pheromone baited traps located at various distances from these logs. The number of marked beetles captured decreased exponentially with increasing distance from the release point. The sex ratio of the bark beetles was more female biased the further they were recaptured from the logs, being 57{\%} and 60{\%} at distances of up to 50 and 100 m, respectively. The maximum distance flown by a marked beetle recorded in this experiment was 1094 m. A model fitted to the data on dispersal indicates that 10{\%} of the spruce bark beetles dispersed over distances of 55 m and 4 m in spring (overwintered parental generation) and summer (first filial generation), respectively. Differences between spring and summer swarming are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {While sustainable forestry in Europe is characterized by the provision of a multitude of forest ecosystem services, there exists no comprehensive study that scrutinizes their sensitivity to forest management on a pan-European scale, so far. We compile scenario runs from regionally tailored forest growth models and Decision Support Systems (DSS) from 20 case studies throughout Europe and analyze whether the ecosystem service provision depends on management intensity and other co-variables, comprising regional affiliation, social environment, and tree species composition. The simulation runs provide information about the case-specifically most important ecosystem services in terms of appropriate indicators. We found a strong positive correlation between management intensity and wood production, but only weak correlation with protective and socioeconomic forest functions. Interestingly, depending on the forest region, we found that biodiversity can react in both ways, positively and negatively, to increased management intensity. Thus, it may be in tradeoff or in synergy with wood production and forest resource maintenance. The covariables species composition and social environment are of punctual interest only, while the affiliation to a certain region often makes an important difference in terms of an ecosystem service's treatment sensitivity.},

abstract = {The appearance of the natural disturbance dynamics paradigm in forest ecology has contributed to a more diversified view of forest dynamics. Disturbances in forests range from small to large-scale and from abiotic to biotic, and the mix varies considerably among regions. It is currently acknowledged that boreal forest disturbance and succes- sional features may vary substantially according to the characteristics of the dominant tree species, local site conditions, landscape and regional climate. This has important consequences for how forests ought to be managed by protection, management and restoration to produce renewable resources, maintain biodiversity, and provide ecosys- tem services. Focussing on Europe's conifer-dominated forests we present different dis- turbances, disturbance regimes and forest vegetation types found in boreal, hemiboreal and mountain forests. For developing practical approaches to biodiversity conservation it is useful to separate three broadly defined types of forest dynamics 1) succession after severe stand-replacing disturbances, 2) cohort dynamics related to partial disturbances and 3) gap dynamics caused by the death of individual trees or small groups of trees. We use this classification to discuss and define approaches for conservation planning and sustainable forest management. Developing management methods for maintenance of viable populations and important ecosystem processes requires an understanding of how the quality, size, juxtaposition and functional connectivity of the different forest vegetation elements affect species and ecosystem processes at the landscape scale. We emphasise the need for both conservation of networks of forest with different dynamics and studying large intact forest areas which are representative for different ecoregions.},

abstract = {Political agendas worldwide include increased production of biofuel, which multiplies the trade-offs among conflicting objectives, including food and fodder production, water quantity, water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Quantification of trade-offs among objectives in bioenergy crop production is most frequently accomplished by a comparison of a limited number of plausible scenarios. Here we analyze biophysical trade-offs among bioenergy crop production based on rape seed, food crop production, water quantity, and water quality in the Parthe catchment in Central Germany. Based on an integrated river basin model (SWAT) and a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), we estimated Pareto optimal frontiers among multiple objectives. Results indicate that the same level of bioenergy crop production can be achieved at different costs with respect to the other objectives. Intermediate rapeseed production does not lead to strong trade-offs with water quality and low flow if a reduction of food and fodder production can be accepted. Compared to solutions focused on maximizing food and fodder yield, solutions with intermediate rapeseed production even improve with respect to water quality and low flow. If rapeseed production is further increased, negative effects on low flow prevail. The major achievement of the optimization approach is the quantification of the functional trade-offs for the feasible range of all objectives. The application of the approach provides the results of what is in effect an infinite number of scenarios. We offer a general methodology that may be used to support recommendations for the best way to achieve certain goals, and to compare the optimal outcomes given different policy preferences. In addition, visualization options of the resulting non-dominated solutions are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: Although the negative effects of habitat fragmentation have been widely documented at the landscape scale, much less is known about its impacts on species distributions at the biogeographical scale. We hypothesize that fragmentation influences the large-scale distribution of area- and edge-sensitive species by limiting their occurrence in regions with fragmented habitats, despite otherwise favourable environmental conditions. We test this hypothesis by assessing the interplay of climate and landscape factors influencing the distribution of the calandra lark, a grassland specialist that is highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. Location: Iberia Peninsula, Europe. Methods: Ecological niche modelling was used to investigate the relative influence of climate/topography, landscape fragmentation and spatial structure on calandra lark distribution. Modelling assumed explicitly a hierarchically structured effect among explanatory variables, with climate/topography operating at broader spatial scales than landscape variables. An eigenvector-based spatial filtering approach was used to cancel bias introduced by spatial autocorrelation. The information theoretic approach was used in model selection, and variation partitioning was used to isolate the unique and shared effects of sets of explanatory variables. Results: Climate and topography were the most influential variables shaping the distribution of calandra lark, but incorporating landscape metrics contributed significantly to model improvement. The probability of calandra lark occurrence increased with total habitat area and declined with the number of patches and edge density. Variation partitioning showed a strong overlap between variation explained by climate/topography and landscape variables. After accounting for spatial structure in species distribution, the explanatory power of environmental variables remained largely unchanged. Main conclusions: We have shown here that landscape fragmentation can influence species distributions at the biogeographical scale. Incorporating fragmentation metrics into large-scale ecological niche models may contribute for a better understanding of mechanism driving species distributions and for improving predictive modelling of range shifts associated with land use and climate changes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Forest certification as a voluntary verification tool has been providing an independent assessment of sustainable forestry practices and thus confidence in sustainability benchmarks for over 20 years. Using either the international or national approaches and initiatives, two main forest certification systems, PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) and FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), have spread in a number of countries worldwide. The specifics of local conditions in the forestry sector have to be taken into account when implementing the certification context in a given country or a region. Apart from the natural conditions, institutional structure, or legislative framework, it is also the local and national stakeholders and their perception of this issue that provides the background for the implementation of the certification criteria. The main objective of this study is to examine the general understanding of the certification concept as an environmental, economic, and social tool, and to determine the incentives of forest owners in Slovakia for sustainable forest management (SFM) certification. In addition, the benefits and problems arising from participation in certification were identified and differences reflecting the ownership structure of forests, size of forest area, and participation in a particular certification programme were analysed. Results indicate that certified forest owners, unlike non-certified, demonstrated a high level of understanding of the SFM certification concept. Certified entities mainly consider forest certification as their commitment to environmental responsibility and a tool for improving external company image, promoting sustainable utilisation of forest resources, and improving forest management practices. The main benefits are linked to the possibility to demonstrate forest management practices, a better understanding of the forest management concept, and improvement of forest management practices. PEFC users perceive more benefits following from certification; the most important are those associated with non-economic values, while FSC-certified forest owners perceive mainly economic benefits connected to market penetration, increased sales volume, and potential price premiums. The key problems associated with certification relate to duties to ensure compliance with certification criteria by contractors and administrative difficulties. Respondents reported minimum price premiums for the sale of their certified timber. Additionally, the findings of the study pointed out that a nationally developed certification system can better recognise the roles and objectives of forest certification in the context of forest policy.},

For high forests, for instance, most income is derived from thinning and felling up to 80 (sycamore and ash) or even 120 years (oak) after planting. Cost-benefit analysis of such long-term investments is enormously sensitive to the discount rate. Using conventional exponential discounting can generate recommendations that appear contrary to sustainability, if not commonsense.

abstract = {Increased mortality of forest trees, driven directly or indirectly by climate change, is occurring around the world. In western North America, whitebark pine, a high elevation keystone species, and lodgepole pine, a widespread ecologically and economically important tree, have experienced extensive mortality in recent climate-driven outbreaks of the mountain pine beetle. However, even in stands experiencing high levels of mortality, some mature trees have survived. We hypothesized that the outbreak acted as a natural selection event, removing trees most susceptible to the beetle and least adapted to warmer drier conditions. If this was the case, genetic change would be expected at loci underlying beetle resistance. Given we did not know the basis for resistance, we used inter-simple sequence repeats to compare the genetic profiles of two sets of trees, survivors (mature, living trees) and general population (trees just under the diameter preferred by the beetles and expected to approximate the genetic structure of each tree species at the site without beetle selection). This method detects high levels of polymorphism and has often been able to detect patterns associated with phenotypic traits. For both whitebark and lodgepole pine, survivors and general population trees mostly segregated independently indicating a genetic basis for survivorship. Exceptions were a few general population trees that segregated with survivors in proportions roughly reflecting the proportion of survivors versus beetle-killed trees. Our results indicate that during outbreaks, beetle choice may result in strong selection for trees with greater resistance to attack. Our findings suggest that survivorship is genetically based and, thus, heritable. Therefore, retaining survivors after outbreaks to act as primary seed sources could act to promote adaptation.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. The Nordic countries have long traditions in forest inventory and remote sensing (RS). In sample-based national forest inventories (NFIs), utilization of aerial photographs started during the 1960s, satellite images during the 1980s, laser scanning during the 2000s, and photogrammetric point clouds during the 2010s. In forest management inventories (FMI), utilization of aerial photos started during the 1940s and laser scanning during the 2000s. However, so far, RS has mostly been used for map production and research rather than for estimation of regional parameters or inference on their accuracy. In recent years, the RS technology has been developing very fast. At the same time, the needs for information are constantly increasing. New technologies have created possibilities for cost-efficient production of accurate, large area forest data sets, which also will change the way forest inventories are done in the future. In this study, we analyse the state-of-the-art both in the NFIs and FMIs in the Nordic countries. We identify the benefits and drawbacks of different RS materials and data acquisition approaches with different user perspectives. Based on the analysis, we identify the needs for further development and emerging research questions. We also discuss alternatives for ownership of the data and cost-sharing between different actors in the field.},

abstract = {The contribution of ecosystems to human well-being has been widely recognised. Taking into account existing trade-offs between ecosystem services (ES) at the farm scale and the dependence of multiple ES on processes that take place at the landscape scale, long-term preservation of multifunctional landscapes must be a priority. Studies carried out from such perspective, and those that develop appropriate indicators, could provide useful tools for integrating ES in landscape planning. In this study we propose a new integrative environmental indicator based on the ES provided by the landscape and named "multiple ecosystem services landscape index" (MESLI). Because synergies and trade-offs between ES are produced at regional or local levels, being different from those perceived at larger scales, MESLI was developed at municipality level. Furthermore, in order to identify main drivers of change in ES provision at the landscape scale an analysis of the relationship between the environmental and the socioeconomic characteristics of the municipalities was carried out. The study was located in the Basque Country and the results demonstrated that the MESLI index is a good tool to measure landscape multifunctionality at local scales. It is effective evaluating landscapes, distinguishing between municipalities based on ES provision, and identifying the drivers of change and their effects. This information about ES provisioning at the local level is usually lacking; therefore, MESLI would be very useful for policy-makers and land managers because it provides relevant information to local scale decision-making.},

abstract = {The main ecosystem services (ES) central European mountain forests provide are: protection against gravitational hazards, timber production, recreation, biodiversity conservation and carbon storage, which are all in high demand. These demands make managing mountain forests a challenging task, involving manifold synergies and conflicts between the different ES. There is therefore an urgent need for appropriate concepts and tools for support decisions in forest management and planning (FMP) to take into consideration all ES and to manage the wide variety of information types, parameters and uncertainties involved in assessing the sustainability of ES. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides a suitable set of methods for sustainability evaluations. In this study sustainability means the persistent fulfilment of the required ES. To address all the phases of the FMP process, MCDA and forest models should be applied together, with indicators providing the main interfaces to combine them. This paper aims to: i) review assessment approaches in order to select appropriate and widely accepted indicators for measuring and assessing the effects of different silvicultural management alternatives on forest ES, and ii) present additional standardisation approaches (value functions) for each indicator. Standardisations are necessary to make the different ES comparable and to study synergies and trade-offs between different management objectives in MCDA. The main ES in central European mountain regions are considered, with a clear focus on those indicators that are directly derivable from forest model outputs and that can refer to sustainable forest management practices. The scales considered are that of the single forest stand and of the larger forest management unit. A holistic indicator-based analysis framework for FMP in mountain forests can be built using the indicators and value functions described. The influence of different management alternatives on ES can then be evaluated, taking into consideration the instruments and information on forest management (forest models, inventory) available. All indicators are selected according to existing and approved approaches that only require data that is normally available in operational forest management. The framework can thus be an important element in developing a decision support system for FMP in mountain forests.},

There is increasing consensus about the importance of incorporating these "ecosystem services" into resource management decisions, but quantifying the levels and values of these services has proven difficult. We use a spatially explicit modeling tool, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), to predict changes in ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and commodity production levels. We apply InVEST to stakeholder-defined scenarios of land-use/land-cover change in the Willamette Basin, Oregon. We found that scenarios that received high scores for a variety of ecosystem services also had high scores for biodiversity, suggesting there is little tradeoff between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Scenarios involving more development had higher commodity production values, but lower levels of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. However, including payments for carbon sequestration alleviates this tradeoff. Quantifying ecosystem services in a spatially explicit manner, and analyzing tradeoffs between them, can help to make natural resource decisions more effective, efficient, and defensible.},

abstract = {Understanding the interactions between the multiple ecosystem services (ES) which can be delivered from a single landscape is essential. Most studies on ES relationships use spatial or temporal statistical analysis (for example: correlations between services). Methods from microeconomic theory have recently received attention for describing ES relationships. The nature and intensity of ES relationships can be assessed by fitting a production possibility frontier that indicates the maximum amount of one ES that can be produced by landscape, for different levels of another ES. This study estimates production frontiers empirically, and compares the ES relationships insights gained this way with those inferred from correlation approaches. InVEST software was used to model and map the provision of six ES in the Reventaz{\'{o}}n watershed in Costa Rica. Spatial and temporal ES correlation patterns were analyzed for four observed land uses/land covers (LULC). Production frontiers were constructed using a set of 32 simulated scenarios. Production frontier was the most sensitive method for detecting ES relationships. The nature and intensity of ES relationships revealed depended on the analytic methods used. In comparison with correlations, the production frontier approach provided additional information relating to tradeoff intensity and Pareto efficient LULC configurations.},

abstract = {Managing multiple ecosystem services (ESs) in a win-win manner is a necessary and challenging task. However, our understanding of the spatial interactions among ESs is relatively limited, particularly in mountainous areas. Using the global biodiversity hotspot known as the Three Parallel Rivers Region in Southwest China as a case study, this paper systematically investigated the spatial trade-offs and synergies among 8 ESs (i.e. crop production, livestock-raising, water supply, carbon storage, carbon sequestration, soil retention, habitat support and nature recreation). We mapped the township-level distributions of the 8 ESs and measured their relationships using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and overlap analyses of ES hotspots/coldspots. Four types of ES bundles were identified by applying the K-means clustering analysis to the 8 ESs. Our results revealed high to moderate levels of interactions among most pairs of ESs. Most provisioning services showed trade-offs with ESs of the other categories, whereas most regulating services demonstrated synergies with other ESs. The ES bundles presented a reasonable set of ecological zones that were characterized by the provisions of different ESs. The spatial patterns of ESs and their interactions corresponded well to the regional socio-ecological gradients in topography, climate and human activities. Our results should have important applications in regional decision-makings on economic development and environmental conservation. This study also provides a good case for demonstrating the complex relationships among ESs in a typical mountainous biodiversity hotspot.},

abstract = {Considering the increasing uptake of the concept of "ecosystem services" in landscape management and environmental policies, it is urgent to establish a consensual framework to assess the complex relationships among ecosystem services, considering both the supply- and the demand-sides. A diversity of approaches have been proposed to evaluate ecosystem services associations, but not all methods are equivalent and methodological choices need to be made depending on the scientific and policy questions at hand, as well as the type of data available. Based on previous classifications of ecosystem service associations, we propose to characterize three broad types of associations considering the ecological (supply side) and socio-economical (demand side) aspects of ecosystem services: supply-supply, supply-demand and demand-demand. We then review quantitative methods available and propose guidelines to assess those three categories of relationships among ecosystem services and identify their explanatory variables following three steps: (i) detecting ecosystem services associations, (ii) defining bundles and (iii) identifying the explanatory variables of ecosystem services associations. For each step, strengths and weaknesses of different statistical analysis and machine learning methods are described. The proposed interdisciplinary methodological approach takes one step toward embracing such complexity of socio-ecological systems as it considers ecosystem services delivery (supply-supply), stakeholders' needs (demand-demand), and on how stakeholders can benefit from the ecosystem services delivery (supply-demand). We illustrate how such a diverse spectrum of methods may apply for land management.},

This is the case for the city of Bilbao (Bizkaia, Basque Country), where a Greenbelt has been maintained surrounding the urban areas allowing the periurban areas to deliver ecosystem services (ES) to society. However, the role of the different ecosystems in the provision of ES is not the same, which can lead to conflicts among them. The aim of this study is to analyze the synergies and trade-offs among the eight most important ES in the Bilbao Metropolitan Greenbelt (BMG) to orient their management strategies towards more multifunctional landscapes. We mapped the ES and overlapped them looking for the most relevant areas for the provision of multiple ES and areas that are mostly lacking ES provision. We identify also existing ES trade-offs and synergies between ES using correlations so that managers can prioritize preservation efforts of land use types in the rest of the area. The results show that provisioning ES had trade-offs with regulating and cultural ES and the latter showed synergies between them. The former are mainly delivered by semi-natural ecosystems, while regulating and cultural ES are delivered mainly by natural ecosystems. Moreover, the most relevant areas for the provision of multiple ES were proposed as potential components of a Green Infrastructure (GI). Their identification and ES bundles could help decision-makers to orient their management strategies towards sustainability in metropolitan areas.},

abstract = {Large and old trees have a vital role in preserving biodiversity in forest ecosystems. We used National Forest Inventory data from 1921 to 2013 for studying changes in densities (stems per ha) of large trees (diameter ≥40 cm) in Finland. In addition, densities of old trees (age ≥150 years) are reported from 1971 to 2013. We present results separately for the three subzones of the boreal biogeographical zone. Large trees have increased as much as 325{\%}. The change has occurred mainly since the 1970s. On country level, old trees have become slightly less common (−4{\%}) since the 1970s, although a decrease was actually observed only in the northern boreal subzone. The large majority of old trees in Finland are quite small in diameter, however. Trees that are both large and old show a notable increase from 1971 to 2013. During the 2010s, densities of large trees were higher in the southern boreal subzone than in the northern boreal subzone, but in the 1920s the opposite was true. Densities of old trees have been much higher in the northern boreal subzone. The observed densities of large trees are still considerably smaller than those observed in unmanaged old-growth forests in Scandinavia. High densities of large and/or old trees were observed in areas with restrictions on wood production emphasizing their role in maintaining biodiversity. The results reflect the destructive effects of former land use and the transition from dimensional cuttings to clear cuts and thinning from below after the 1940s. Proportionally larger changes were observed for southern Finland, where a higher human population density and the resulting more intensive land use had more severe detrimental effects on forests. As the densities of large trees and old trees have developed in a completely different manner in Finland, our results suggest that monitoring only the size distribution of trees will not sufficiently describe the role of old trees as constituents of biodiversity. Thereagainst, densities of large trees and large old trees developed in a similar manner.},

abstract = {Models were developed for predicting the decomposition of dead wood for the main tree species in Finland, based on data collected from long-term thinning experiments in southern and central Finland. The decomposition rates were strongly related to the number of years after tree death. In contrast to previous studies, which have used the first-order exponential model, we found that the decomposition rate was not constant. Therefore, the Gompertz and Chapman-Richard's functions were fitted to the data. The slow initial decomposition period was mainly due to the fact that most dead trees remained standing as snags after their death. The initial period was followed by a period of rapid decomposition and, finally, by a period of moderately slow decomposition. Birch stems decomposed more rapidly than Scots pine and Norway spruce stems. Decomposition rates of Norway spruce stems were somewhat lower than those of Scots pine. Because the carbon concentration of decaying boles was relatively stable (about 50{\%}) the rate of carbon loss follows that of mass loss. Models were also developed for the probability that a dead tree remains standing as a snag. During the first years after death, the probability was high. Thereafter, it decreased rapidly, the decrease being faster for birch stems than for Scots pine and Norway spruce stems. Almost all stems had fallen down within 40 years after their death. In Scots pine and Norway spruce, most snags remained hard and belonged to decay class 1. In birch, a higher proportion of snags belonged to the more advanced decay classes. The models provide a framework for predicting dead wood dynamics in managed as well as dense unthinned stands. The models can be incorporated into forest management planning systems, thereby facilitating estimates of carbon dynamics.},

abstract = {While biodiversity loss continues globally, assessments of regional and local change over time have been equivocal. Here, we assess changes in plant species richness and beta diversity over 140 years at the level of regions within a country. Using 19th‐century flora censuses for 14 Danish regions as a baseline, we overcome previous criticisms concerning short time series and neglect of completely altered habitats. We find that species composition has changed dramatically and directionally across all regions. Substantial species losses were more than offset by large gains, resulting in a net increase in species richness in all regions. The occupancy of initially widespread species increased, while initially rare species lost terrain. These changes were accompanied by strong biotic homogenization; i.e. regions are more similar now than they were 140 years ago. Species declining in Denmark were found to be in similar decline all over Northern Europe.},

abstract = {The Carpathians are the largest European mountain range and harbour exceptional biodiversity. However, recent and anticipated changes in climate along with rapid social and economic development suggest that the region's values may not be sustained. We strived to identify the main regional climate change hot-spots and evaluate the distribution of climatically exposed land-use types and ecosystems. The analysis was based on 10 climate models driven by the emission scenario A1B. To identify the hot-spots, we adopted a methodology based on change trajectories in a multidimensional climate space. Three hot-spots were in the Western Carpathians (Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary), two were in Ukraine, and three were in the Romanian and Serbian Carpathians. Regions with the highest aggregate climate exposure (i.e. above 70 {\%} of the regional range) were mostly covered by broadleaved forests (39 {\%}), agricultural land (30 {\%}), and pastures and woodlands (15 {\%}). These regions also contained 15 {\%} of protected areas and 36 {\%} of the total human population in the Carpathians. While growing season length was the main factor affecting hot-spot magnitude in the north-west, precipitation-related variables were the main factors in the east and south. Analysis of inter-climate model variability indicated that the level of confidence in hot-spot position and magnitude differed among hot-spots. In addition to identifying a large-scale regional pattern of climate change, we showed that there are sub-regions with remarkably high climate exposure. The hot-spot distribution in lower elevations suggests that Carpathian ecosystems in water-limited environment may be particularly exposed to climate change.},

Extensive tracts of boreal forests are actively managed for timber production, but actions aimed at increasing timber yields also affect other forest functions and services. Here, we present an overview of the environmental impacts of forest management from the perspective of ecosystem services. We show how prevailing forestry practices may have substantial but diverse effects on the various ecosystem services provided by boreal forests. Several aspects of these processes remain poorly known and warrant a greater role in future studies, including the role of community structure. Conflicts among different interests related to boreal forests are most likely to occur, but the concept of ecosystem services may provide a useful framework for identifying and resolving these conflicts.},

abstract = {Simulation models are widely used to represent the dynamics of ecological systems. A common question with such models is how changes to a parameter value or functional form in the model alter the results. Some authors have chosen to answer that question using frequentist statistical hypothesis tests (e.g. ANOVA). This is inappropriate for two reasons. First, p-values are determined by statistical power (i.e. replication), which can be arbitrarily high in a simulation context, producing minuscule p-values regardless of the effect size. Second, the null hypothesis of no difference between treatments (e.g. parameter values) is known a priori to be false, invalidating the premise of the test. Use of p-values is troublesome (rather than simply irrelevant) because small p-values lend a false sense of importance to observed differences. We argue that modelers should abandon this practice and focus on evaluating the magnitude of differences between simulations.},

abstract = {Within the northern Great Lakes region, mesoscale (10s to 100s of km2) forest patterning is driven by disturbance dynamics. Using original Public Land Survey (PLS) records in northern Wisconsin, USA, we study spatial patterns of wind and fire disturbances during the pre-Euroamerican settlement period (ca. 1850). Our goals were: (1) to determine how effectively wind and fire disturbance can be reconstructed from the PLS, (2) to assess the roles of wind and fire in shaping vege{\~{}}ation patterns, (3) to evaluate landscape to regional controls of wind and fire regimes, and (4) to assess the potential for interactions between these disturbances. Our analyses indicate that only relatively intense fire and wind disturbance can be reliably detected from the PLS (62-68{\%} canopy removal). Heavy windthrow was more prevalent than fire disturbance in presettlement forests, and wind-disturbed patches were comparatively smaller and tnore complex in shape. Disturbance rotation periods ranged between 450 and 10 500 years for heavy windthrow and between 700 and 93 000 years for stand-replacing fire. Occurrences of wind and fire disturbance were related to geographic province and to regional soil patterns: analysis further suggests a negative interaction between the two disturbance types. Given that severe wind disturbance was infrequent, mature to old forests of late-suc-cessional species dominated much of pre-Euroamerican northern Wisconsin, but wind disturbances may have allowed regional persistence of less shade-tolerant species, such as Betula alleghaniensis. Pine-dominated vegetation was limited to regions with more frequent fire, but frequencies of stand-replacing fire derived from survey records were insufficient to maintain these successional vegetation types; we suggest that frequent surface fires, not recorded in the PLS, along with infrequent stand-replacing fire, maintained these vegetation types. The extensive nature of the PLS provides a powerful baseline for addressing changes in forest conditions and disturbance regimes associated with climate and land use for both the present and more distant past. Such baselines are informative in discussions of historical variability and restoration silviculture.},

The future development of forest landscapes is very much dependent on how forest owners act and what goes on in the wider world; thus, models are needed that incorporate these aspects. The objective of this study is to assess how nine European state-of-the-art forest DSSs cope with these issues. The assessment focuses on the ability of these DSSs to generate landscape-level scenarios to explore the output of current and alternative forest management models (FMMs) in terms of a range of ESs and the robustness of these FMMs in the face of increased risks and uncertainty. Results show that all DSSs assessed in this study can be used to quantify the impacts of both stand-and landscape-level FMMs on the provision of a range of ESs over a typical planning horizon. DSSs can be used to assess how timber price trends may impact that provision over time. The inclusion of forest owner behavior as reflected by the adoption of specific FMMs seems to be also in the reach of all DSSs. Nevertheless, some DSSs need more data and development of models to estimate the impacts of climate change on biomass production and other ESs. Spatial analysis functionality needs to be further developed for a more accurate assessment of the landscape-level output of ESs from both current and alternative FMMs.},

abstract = {{\#}{\#}{\#} Background Trees are major components of many terrestrial ecosystems and are grown in managed plantations and orchards to provide a variety of economically important products, including timber, pulp, fiber, and food. They are subject to a wide range of pests and diseases, of which the most important causative agents are viruses, bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and insect herbivores. Research on tree pests and diseases has had a historical focus on trees of direct economic importance. However, some epidemics and infestations have damaged and killed common trees that are integral parts of natural ecosystems. These have harmed valuable landscapes and highlighted the wide-ranging consequences arising from tree pests and diseases. There is also growing concern that aspects of globalization—in particular, higher volumes and new forms of trade—may increase the risk of disease spread. ![Graphic][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} A forest providing numerous ecosystem services is subject to a disease epidemic that reduces the abundance of a dominant native species, resulting in a change in forest structure. Initially, a wide range of ecosystem services ( A to D ) are harmed. But as trees grow to replace lost species, some (perhaps carbon storage or water purification) are regained, whereas others (perhaps the biodiversity supported by the diseased tree species) are permanently disrupted. Policy measures can both help prevent new diseases being introduced (the first stage) or improve recovery through management practices or planting resistant trees. {\#}{\#}{\#} Advances We review the challenges in maintaining tree health in natural and managed ecosystems. It is argued that it is helpful to consider explicitly the consequences of pests and diseases for the full range of ecosystem services provided by trees. In addition to forest and orchard products, tree pests and diseases can affect the ability of forests to sequester and store carbon, reduce flood risk, and purify water. They can affect the biodiversity supported by trees and the recreational and cultural values accorded to woodland by people. Many of these benefits are uncosted and enjoyed by different classes of stakeholders, which raises difficult questions about who should be responsible for measures to protect tree health. Changes in the risk of pest and disease introduction, the increasing prevalence of genetic reassortment leading to novel disease threats, and the potential role of climate change are all highlighted. {\#}{\#}{\#} Outlook Modern pest and disease management is based on an extensive science base that is rapidly developing, spurred in particular by modern molecular technologies. A research priority is to build a better understanding of why certain pathogens and insects become major pests and diseases. This will involve a better understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity and herbivory, as will ecological insights into why some species reach epidemic prevalence or abundance. It will also help anticipate which species may become a problem if they are transported to new geographical regions, recombine with other organisms, or experience new climatic conditions. However, identifying all species that may become pests will be impossible, and the Review stresses the importance of risk management at the “pathway of introduction” level, especially when modern trade practices provide potential new routes of entry. Last, when ecosystem services are provided by woods and forests rather than individual tree species, we need to understand better the consequences of pests and diseases that attack or feed on particular species. Trees can be affected by a wide variety of diseases caused by insects, fungi, and other pathogens. Such diseases often make the headlines—particularly when iconic tree species are affected—for example, in the case of the ash dieback currently spreading through Europe, or the chestnut blight that devastated American chestnut trees. But what is the effect of these diseases on ecosystem services performed by trees in natural and managed ecosystems? Boyd et al. (p. [10.1126/science.1235773][2] ) review the spread of tree diseases, as a result of globalization and climate change, and analyze the resulting damage to timber and fruit production, to climate regulation, and to parks and woodlands caused by tree diseases. Trees and forests provide a wide variety of ecosystem services in addition to timber, food, and other provisioning services. New approaches to pest and disease management are needed that take into account these multiple services and the different stakeholders they benefit, as well as the likelihood of greater threats in the future resulting from globalization and climate change. These considerations will affect priorities for both basic and applied research and how trade and phytosanitary regulations are formulated.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V. Forests are critical habitats for biodiversity and they are also essential for the provision of a wide range of ecosystem services that are important to human well-being. There is increasing evidence that biodiversity contributes to forest ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Here we provide a review of forest ecosystem services including biomass production, habitat provisioning services, pollination, seed dispersal, resistance to wind storms, fire regulation and mitigation, pest regulation of native and invading insects, carbon sequestration, and cultural ecosystem services, in relation to forest type, structure and diversity. We also consider relationships between forest biodiversity and multifunctionality, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. We compare the concepts of ecosystem processes, functions and services to clarify their definitions. Our review of published studies indicates a lack of empirical studies that establish quantitative and causal relationships between forest biodiversity and many important ecosystem services. The literature is highly skewed; studies on provisioning of nutrition and energy, and on cultural services, delivered by mixed-species forests are under-represented. Planted forests offer ample opportunity for optimising their composition and diversity because replanting after harvesting is a recurring process. Planting mixed-species forests should be given more consideration as they are likely to provide a wider range of ecosystem services within the forest and for adjacent land uses. This review also serves as the introduction to this special issue of Biodiversity and Conservation on various aspects of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {We studied regeneration dynamics in forests disturbed by three different windthrow events in 2008 in Slovenia to assess the success of natural regeneration vs planting and subsequent silvicultural treatments. Fifty-three plots with planted saplings of Norway spruce and sycamore maple and 50 plots with dominant naturally regenerated saplings were selected in a randomly stratified manner. Sapling characteristics (height, height increment, root collar diameter, free-to-grow score, browsing and micro-site) were assessed in 2012 and 2014. Herbs and seedling establishment were studied in two subplots within each plot. Average seedling density was 13,074 and 14,674 ha−1 four and six years after the windthrows, respectively. Seedlings were irregularly distributed, which suggests micro-site differences in regeneration dynamics. The results indicated lower seedling success on sites that were southerly exposed, farther from the forest edge and seed trees, on undisturbed micro-sites and at higher altitudes. On such sites planting was justified. While seedling density indicated a positive relation to herb coverage, sapling survival was negatively associated with it as well as with browsing. Initial sapling height was the strongest predictor of survival. Spruce saplings had the lowest mortality, while shade-tolerant silver fir and beech experienced high mortality. The study indicated a high density and species diversity of naturally regenerated seedlings within windthrow areas, which was reduced by planting, mowing of competing vegetation and protection measures favouring planted saplings. Recommendations for the improvement of silvicultural operations for post windthrow restoration are given.},

Policymakers and those with an economic interest in harvesting trees typically argue that damaged areas should be logged so as to avoid “wasting” resources, while many forest ecologists contend that removing trees following a disturbance is harmful to a variety of forest species and can interfere with the natural process of ecosystem recovery. Salvage Logging and Its Ecological Consequences brings together three leading experts on forest ecology to explore a wide range of issues surrounding the practice of salvage logging. They gather and synthesize the latest research and information about its economic and ecological costs and benefits, and consider the impacts of salvage logging on ecosystem processes and biodiversity. The book examines • what salvage logging is and why it is controversial • natural and human disturbance regimes in forested ecosystems • differences between salvage harvesting and traditional timber harvesting • scientifically documented ecological impacts of salvage operations • the importance of land management objectives in determining appropriate post-disturbance interventions  Brief case studies from around the world highlight a variety of projects, including operations that have followed wildfires, storms, volcanic eruptions, and insect infestations. In the final chapter, the authors discuss policy management implications and offer prescriptions for mitigating the impacts of future salvage harvesting efforts. Salvage Logging and Its Ecological Consequences is a “must-read” volume for policymakers, students, academics, practitioners, and professionals involved in all aspects of forest management, natural resource planning, and forest conservation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The authors 2017. The consequences of large-scale disturbances magnified by climate extremes and land-use changes in Norway spruce forests in the Tatra Mountains (Slovakia) are assessed in this study. The study area is part of the territory of Tatra National Park (TANAP). The driver-pressure- state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework was applied to evaluate how the ecosystem and its services are affected. The state of the ecosystem and its potential for provisioning ecosystem services before and after disturbances is expressed by a set of indicators derived mostly from long-term ecological research conducted in TANAP. The differences are classified by a standardised change index (CI). Ten years after the major windthrow disturbance in 2004, all ecosystem services were still below the pre-disturbance state. The most pronounced declines were found in cultural (average CI = 0.69) and provisioning (average CI = 0.86) ecosystem services. Regulating services are recovering faster (average CI = 0.97), with some indicators exceeding the state before the disturbances. Significant changes took place at the tree line, which is a new phenomenon not known from previous disturbances. Despite a gradual recovery of the ecosystem state and functioning, this analysis confirms that there is a serious risk of decline in forest ecosystem benefits according to regional climate change projections. It also indicates the increasing importance of sustainable forest management for safeguarding ecosystem services under changing conditions.},

abstract = {Outbreaks of pests are considered one of the most destructive types of natural forest disorders. In recent years the severity of such outbreaks has rapidly increased due to the process of global warming, which affects the rate of reproduction of pests and the range of their natural distribution. Economic consequences of these types of disturbances are of particular importance. Though many studies have been conducted in the field of tree phytophages ecology, the issues of estimating economic damage and the formation of mechanisms for its minimization have been poorly studied. This article presents a review of studies on the problem of the harmful effects of forest pests classified by their localization. The area of study includes mainly boreal forests located in a number of European countries, the USA, Canada and Russia. Our study reviews the range of instruments applied to prevent disturbances mentioned above and mitigate corresponding negative consequences. Despite the fact that there are theoretical approaches to the analysis of the economic consequences of forest damage by pests, they still cannot find practical application},

abstract = {Given the increasingly global stresses on forests, many ecologists argue that managers must maintain ecological resilience: the capacity of ecosystems to absorb disturbances without undergoing fundamental change. In this review we ask: Can the emerging paradigm of natural-disturbance-based management (NDBM) maintain ecological resilience in managed forests? Applying resilience theory requires careful articulation of the ecosystem state under consideration, the disturbances and stresses that affect the persistence of possible alternative states, and the spatial and temporal scales of management relevance. Implementing NDBM while maintaining resilience means recognizing that (i) biodiversity is important for long-term ecosystem persistence, (ii) natural disturbances play a critical role as a generator of structural and compositional heterogeneity at multiple scales, and (iii) traditional management tends to produce forests more homogeneous than those disturbed naturally and increases the likelihood of unexpected catastrophic change by constraining variation of key environmental processes. NDBM may maintain resilience if silvicultural strategies retain the structures and processes that perpetuate desired states while reducing those that enhance resilience of undesirable states. Such strategies require an understanding of harvesting impacts on slow ecosystem processes, such as seed-bank or nutrient dynamics, which in the long term can lead to ecological surprises by altering the forest's capacity to reorganize after disturbance},

abstract = {Wind disturbance is the main natural driver of forest dynamics in Central and Northern Europe, but little is known regarding the general patterns of tree regeneration following windthrow in this region. On the basis of 89 windthrow gaps, we quantified natural tree regeneration 10 and 20years after wind disturbance, and identified the factors influencing tree regeneration dynamics, with a special emphasis on the post-storm management practices "salvage logging" and "no intervention". The sample encompasses gaps of ≥3ha and total overstory mortality caused by wind disturbance. The gaps date back to the two catastrophic storm events Vivian in 1990 and Lothar in 1999. Gaps covered an ecologically diverse region extending over 20,000km2 and ranging from 370 to 1780ma.s.l. on the Central Plateau and in the Alps of Switzerland (Central Europe). Regeneration status was assessed on six circular sample plots per windthrow gap in 2010/2011. We recorded soil pH, organic layer, post-windthrow treatment, elevation, aspect, slope, browsing damage, and presence of predominant vegetation cover. We compared regeneration density and composition in gaps with and without salvage logging and elucidated the most important environmental factors influencing tree regeneration after wind disturbance using generalized linear models (GLMs). Ten and twenty years after wind disturbance, late-successional tree species such as beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) frequently dominated, independent of the post-storm treatment. Salvage logging did not negatively affect pre-storm regeneration and even positively influenced post-storm tree regeneration. GLMs revealed soil pH (+) and ground vegetation cover (-) to be the most important predictors of sapling density. The findings demonstrate that site factors have a stronger effect than post-storm treatment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Insect outbreaks and wind storms are the most common natural disturbances affecting the northern slopes of montane Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) forests in the European Alps. The combined effects on stand dynamics, including tree regeneration, of these natural disturbances and an anthropogenic (i.e., salvage logging) disturbance were studied to assess the role of post-disturbance management practices. The study areas were in two adjacent inner valleys of the Aosta Valley Autonomous Region (western Italian Alps). Les Combes study area experienced an insect (Lymantria monacha L.) outbreak that affected 91. ha in 1984-1990, while a wind storm impacted 70. ha in the other valley (Parriod study area) in 1990. Salvage logging took place in both study areas 2. years after the natural disturbance occurrence (i.e., in 1991-1992 in Les Combes, and in 1992-1993 in Parriod), and only dead trees were salvaged. Site characteristics, overstory and understory trees, and coarse woody debris (CWD) data were collected during the summer of 2010 in 90. plots randomly distributed within disturbed portions and in control stands of the two study areas. The variability of natural regeneration structure and composition in relation to environment, forest structure, type of disturbance, and salvage logging were analyzed by univariate (i.e., ANOVA and correlations) and multivariate (i.e., MRPP, PCA, and RDA) analyses. Regeneration structure and composition were clearly different for the two disturbance types. Individuals originated mainly from seed after the insect outbreak, while an important role was played by advance regeneration in the windthrow area. Regeneration was more abundant and rich in shade tolerant species (i.e., Abies alba Mill.) after the insect outbreak, while Larix decidua Mill. and light demanding broadleaves were dominant after the windthrow. The two major factors influencing post-disturbance regeneration were the amount of the residual overstory and the amount and distribution of CWD. The presence of residual forest patches facilitated regeneration establishment by reducing herb and shrub competition, and regulating the light that penetrates to the ground. Woodpiles had a negative influence on regeneration in terms of abundance and also influenced composition. On the contrary, scattered CWD facilitated the establishment of new individuals by reducing competition with herbs and shrubs, reducing the impact of browsing, and improving substrate moisture, especially for Norway spruce. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In many parts of the world forest disturbance regimes have intensified recently, and future climatic changes are expected to amplify this development further in the coming decades. These changes are increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global literature review on the impact of three of the most important disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of the boreal, cool-and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i) synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services (P {\textless} 0.001). Indicators of biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by disturbance (P {\textless} 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a 'disturbance paradox', documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance. While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total ecosystem carbon by 38.5{\%} (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by 35.6{\%}. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed.},

It is an area where forest management has been the focus of international discussions by conservationists, forest managers, and stakeholders. The authors developed the empirical windthrow risk model, which involves designing an optimized data structure containing dependent and independent variables entering logistic regression. The results from the model, visualized in the form of map outputs, outline the probability of risk to forest stands from wind in the examined territory of the national park. Such an application of the empirical windthrow risk model could be used as a decision support tool for the mountain spruce forests in a study area. Future development of these models could be useful for other protected European mountain forests dominated by Norway spruce.},

abstract = {Natural disturbances are fundamental to forest ecosystem dynamics and have been used for two decades to improve forest management, notably in the boreal forest. Initially based on fire regimes, there is now a need to extend the concept to include other types of disturbances as they can greatly contribute to forest dynamics in some regions of the boreal zone. Here we review the main descriptors—that is, the severity, specificity, spatial and temporal descriptors and legacies, of windthrow and spruce bud worm outbreak disturbance regimes in boreal forests—in order to facilitate incorporating them into a natural disturbance-based forest management framework. We also describe the biological legacies that are generated by these disturbances. Temporal and spatial descriptors characterising both disturbance types are generally variable in time and space. This makes them difficult to reproduce in an ecosystem management framework. However, severity and specificity descriptors may provide a template upon which policies for maintaining post harvesting and salvage logging biological legacies can be based. In a context in which management mainly targets mature and old-growth stages, integrating insect and wind disturbances in a management framework is an important goal, as these disturbances contribute to creating heterogeneity in mature and old-growth forest characteristics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the Ecological Society of America. Forest disturbances diminish ecosystem services and boost disservices. Because post-disturbance management intends to recover the greatest possible value, selling timber often prevails over other considerations. Ecological research has shown diverse effects of salvage logging, yet such research has focused on the biophysical component of post-disturbance ecosystems and lacks the link with human well-being. Here we bridge that gap under the ecosystem services framework by assessing the impact of post-fire management on a non-timber value. By employing the replacement cost method, we calculated the value of the post-fire natural regeneration of Holm oaks in southern Spain under three post-fire management options by considering the cost of planting instead. The value of this ecosystem service in non-intervention areas doubled that of salvage-logged stands due to the preference for standing dead trees by the main seed disperser. Still, most of the value resulted from the resprouting capacity of oaks. The value of this and other ecosystem services should be added to traditional cost/benefit analyses of post-disturbance management. We thus call for a more holistic approach to salvage logging research, one that explicitly links ecological processes with human well-being through ecosystem services, to better inform decision-makers on the outcomes of post-disturbance management.},

In doing so, we have domesticated landscapes and ecosystems in ways that enhance our food supplies, reduce exposure to predators and natural dangers, and promote commerce. On average, the net benefits to humankind of domesticated nature have been positive. We have, of course, made mistakes, causing unforeseen changes in ecosystem attributes, while leaving few, if any, truly wild places on Earth. Going into the future, scientists can help humanity to domesticate nature more wisely by quantifying the tradeoffs among ecosystem services, such as how increasing the provision of one service may decrease ecosystem resilience and the provision of other services.},

This paper provides a review of different risk concepts and describes how these influence risk management, communication and planning in relation to forest ecosystem services. Based on the review and results of empirical studies, we suggest that personal assessment of risk is decisive in the management of forest ecosystem services. The results are used together with a reviewof different principles of the distribution of risk to propose an approach to risk communication that is effective aswell as ethically sound. Knowledge of heuristics and mutual information on both beliefs and desires are important in the proposed risk communication approach. Such knowledge provides an opportunity for relevant information exchange, so that gaps in personal knowledge maps can be filled in and effective risk communication can be promoted.},

In the second section of the chapter, an overview of actual ecosystem service indicator approaches and a description of frequently used indicators are provided. Different ecosystem types and indicator sets are analyzed. This comparison leads to a discussion about problematic indicators, a distinction of indicators of final and intermediate ecosystem services and service potentials, flows and demands. The third section concentrates on the role of ecosystem service indicators in the 'ecosystem service cascade'. In that context, problems of indicator aggregation are discussed and the position of ecosystem services in human – environmental indicator systems is analyzed.

abstract = {Forest ecosystems provide a wide range of goods and services to society and host high levels of biodiversity. Nevertheless, forest ecosystem services (ES) are often quantified and assessed using simplified methodologies (e.g., proxy methods based exclusively on Land Use Land Cover maps) that introduce substantial uncertainty in the analysis by ignoring, for instance, the species composition and spatial configuration of the ecosystems studied. In this work we defined and calculated a set of 12 indicators of several ES for the forests of the highly populated region of Catalonia (North-eastern Iberian Peninsula). The indicators combined different sources of information such as forest surveys, ecological model predictions and official statistics, but also included additional land cover information. All ES indicators were aggregated at the municipality level to compare their values and distribution patterns. We assessed spatial trade-offs and synergies among ES, as well as their relationships with a set of socioeconomic, climatic and biodiversity variables using correlation analyses and mixed-effects models. The results suggest a clustering of provisioning and regulating ES in mountainous zones towards the North of the study area. These two types of services showed a high degree of spatial similarity and presented high positive correlations. In contrast, cultural ES showed a more scattered pattern, which included lower elevation areas in the South of the study region. Climatic conditions were the main determinants of the spatial variability in the supply of the different ES, with most indicators being positively associated with precipitation and negatively associated with temperature. In addition, biodiversity (particularly woody species richness) showed positive relations with most of these ES, while socioeconomic variables (such as population density and the percentage employment in agriculture) showed negative associations with most of them. The combination of information from different data sources (including primary data) allowed for a detailed analysis of forest ES, likely removing some of the problems derived from approaches based only on proxy methods. In addition, the use of municipalities as study unit makes results directly relevant to management and planning strategies operating at this scale (e.g., forest management and planning).},

abstract = {Human impacts on Earth's ecosystems have greatly intensified in the last decades. This is reflected in unexpected disturbance events, as well as new and increasing socio-economic demands, all of which are affecting the resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide and the provision of important ecosystem services. This Anthropocene era is forcing us to reconsider past and current forest management and silvicultural practices, and search for new ones that are more flexible and better at dealing with the increasing uncertainty brought about by these accelerating and cumulative global changes. Here, we briefly review the focus and limitations of past and current forest management and silvicultural practices mainly as developed in Europe and North America. We then discuss some recent promising concepts, such as managing forests as complex adaptive systems, and approaches based on resilience, functional diversity, assisted migration and multi-species plantations, to propose a novel approach to integrate the functionality of species-traits into a functional complex network approach as a flexible and multi-scale way to manage forests for the Anthropocene. This approach takes into consideration the high level of uncertainty associated with future environmental and societal changes. It relies on the quantification and dynamic monitoring of functional diversity and complex network indices to manage forests as a functional complex network. Using this novel approach, the most efficient forest management and silvicultural practices can be determined, as well as where, at what scale, and at what intensity landscape-scale resistance, resilience and adaptive capacity of forests to global changes can be improved.},

abstract = {Resilience is the magnitude of disturbance that can be tolerated before a socioecological system (SES) moves to a different region of state space controlled by a different set of processes. Resilience has multiple levels of meaning: as a metaphor related to sustainability, as a property of dynamic models, and as a measurable quantity that can be assessed in field studies of SES. The operational indicators of resilience have, however, received little attention in the literature. To assess a system's resilience, one must specify which system configuration and which disturbances are of interest. This paper compares resilience properties in two contrasting SES, lake districts and rangelands, with respect to the following three general features: (a) The ability of an SES to stay in the domain of attraction is related to slowly changing variables, or slowly changing disturbance regimes, which control the boundaries of the domain of attraction or the frequency of events that could push the system across the boundaries. Examples are soil phosphorus content in lake districts woody vegetation cover in rangelands, and property rights systems that affect land use in both lake districts and rangelands. (b) The ability of an SES to self-organize is related to the extent to which reorganization is endogenous rather than forced by external drivers. Self-organization is enhanced by coevolved ecosystem components and the presence of social networks that facilitate innovative problem solving. (c) The adaptive capacity of an SES is related to the existence of mechanisms for the evolution of novelty or learning. Examples include biodiversity at multiple scales and the existence of institutions that facilitate experimentation, discovery, and innovation.},

abstract = {Salvage logging following windthrow is common throughout forests worldwide even though the practice is often considered inimical to forest recovery. Because salvaging removes trees, crushes seedlings, and compacts soils, many warn this practice may delay succession, suppress diversity, and alter composition. Here, over eight years following windthrow, we experimentally evaluate how salvaging affects tree succession across 11 gaps in Eastern deciduous forests of Pennsylvania, USA wherein each gap was divided into salvaged and control (unsalvaged) halves. Our gaps vary in size and windthrow severity and we explicitly account for this variation as well as variation in soil disturbance (i.e., scarification) resulting from salvaging so that our results would be generalizable. Salvage logging had modest and ephemeral impacts on tree succession. Seedling richness and density declined similarly over time in both salvaged and unsalvaged areas as individuals grew into saplings. The primary impact of salvaging on succession occurred where salvaging scarified soils. Here, salvaging caused 41 to 82{\%} declines in sapling abundance, richness, and diversity, but these differences largely disappeared within 5 years. Additionally, we documented interactions between windthrow severity and scarification. Specifically, low severity windthrow and scarification combined reinforced dominance by shade-tolerant and browse-tolerant species (Acer pensylvanicum, Fagus grandifolia). In contrast, high windthrow severity and scarification together reduced the density of a fast growing pioneer tree (Prunus pensylvanica) and non-tree vegetation cover by 75{\%} and 26{\%}, respectively. This reduction enhanced the recruitment of two mid-successional tree species, Acer rubrum and Prunus serotina, by 2 and 3-fold, respectively. Thus, our findings demonstrate that salvaging creates novel microsites and mitigates competing vegetation, thereby enhancing establishment of important hardwoods and promoting tree species coexistence. Our results, coupled with an assessment of 27 published post-windthrow salvage studies, suggest short-term studies may overestimate the impact of salvaging on regeneration. We conclude that the ecological costs and benefits of salvaging depend upon the variation in canopy and soil disturbance severity as well as the timescale at which effects are evaluated. Thus, our findings are inconsistent with the view that salvaging inexorably undermines plant diversity; rather we suggest salvaging can promote tree species coexistence within various contexts.

To cope with the multiple challenges related to global change but also to further improve forest management we need a better understanding of (1) the linkages between drivers of ecosystem change and the state and management of forest ecosystems as well as their capacity to adapt to ongoing global environmental changes, and (2) the interrelationships within and between the components of forest ecosystems. To address the resulting challenges for the state of forest ecosystems in Central Europe, we suggest 45 questions for future ecological research. We define forest ecology as studies on the abiotic and biotic components of forest ecosystems and their interactions on varying spatial and temporal scales. Our questions cover five thematic fields and correspond to the criteria selected for describing the state of Europe's forests by policy makers, i.e. biogeochemical cycling, mortality and disturbances, productivity, biodiversity and biotic interactions, and regulation and protection. We conclude that an improved mechanistic understanding of forest ecosystems is essential for the further development of ecosystem-oriented multifunctional forest management in the face of accelerating global change.},

Defining forest health integrates utilitarian and ecosystem measures of forest condition and function, implemented across a range of spatial scales. Although native forests are adapted to some level of disturbance, all forests now face novel stresses in the form of climate change, air pollution, and invasive pests. Detecting how intensification of these stresses will affect the trajectory of forests is a major scientific challenge that requires developing systems to assess the health of global forests. It is particularly critical to identify thresholds for rapid forest decline, because it can take many decades for forests to restore the services that they provide.},

abstract = {Eruptive herbivores can exert profound landscape level influences. For example, the ongoing mountain pine beetle outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has resulted in mortality of mature lodgepole pine over {\textgreater} 7 million ha. Analysis of the spatio-temporal pattern of spread can lend insights into the processes initiating and/or sustaining such phenomena. We present a landscape level analysis of the development of the current outbreak. Aerial survey assessments of tree mortality, projected onto discrete 12x12 km cells, were used as a proxy for insect population density. We examined whether the outbreak potentially originated from an epicenter and spread, or whether multiple localized populations erupted simultaneously at spatially disjunct locations. An aspatial cluster analysis of time series from 1990 to 2003 revealed four distinct time series patterns. Each time series demonstrated a general progression of increasing mountain pine beetle populations. Plotting the geographical locations of each temporal pattern revealed that the outbreak occurred first in an area of west-central British Columbia, and then in an area to the east. The plot further revealed many localized infestations erupted in geographically disjunct areas, especially in the southern portion of the province. Autologistic regression analyses indicated a significant, positive association between areas where the outbreak first occurred and conservation lands. For example, the delineated area of west-central British Columbia is comprised of three conservation parks and adjacent working forest. We further examined how population synchrony declines with distance at different population levels. Examination of the spatial dependence of temporal synchrony in population fluctuations during early, incipient years (i.e. 1990-1996) suggested that outbreaking mountain pine beetle populations are largely independent at scales {\textgreater} 200 km during non-epidemic periods. However, during epidemic years (i.e. 1999-2003), populations were clearly synchronous across the entire province, even at distances of up to 900 km. The epicentral pattern of population development can be used to identify and prioritize adjacent landscape units for both reactive and proactive management strategies intended to minimize mountain pine beetle impacts},

abstract = {A simple and relatively accurate technique for classifying time-series Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to detect levels of forest harvest is the topic of this research. The accuracy of multidate classification of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) were compared and the effect of the number of years (1–3, 3–4, 5–6 years) between image acquisition on forest change accuracy was evaluated. When Landsat image acquisitions were only 1–3 years apart, forest clearcuts were detected with producer's accuracy ranging from 79{\%} to 96{\%} using the RGB-NDMI classification method. Partial harvests were detected with lower producer's accuracy (55–80{\%}) accuracy. The accuracy of both clearcut and partial harvests decreased as time between image acquisition increased. In all classification trials, the RGB-NDMI method produced significantly higher accuracies, compared to the RGBNDVI. These results are interesting because the less common NDMI (using the reflected middle infrared band) outperformed the more popular NDVI. In northern Maine, industrial forest landowners have shifted from clearcutting to partial harvest systems in recent years. The RGB-NDMI change detection classification applied to Landsat TM imagery collected every 2–3 years appears to be a promising technique for monitoring forest harvesting and other disturbances that do not remove the entire overstory canopy.},

abstract = {The interactions between airflow and trees and forest stands are diverse. They include the reduction in near-surface wind speed and production of turbulence by trees. Near-surface wind conditions affect physiological pro-cesses in trees, tree growth, and survival (Ennos 1997; Eugster 2008). Turbulent components of the flow field dominate the tree response behaviour (Mayer 1987; Gardiner 1995; Schindler et al. 2010) and drive the scalar exchange at the forest–atmosphere interface (Finnigan 2000). Wind–tree interactions take place at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales (de Langre 2008). Aerodynamic drag at all surfaces of the aerial parts of trees—from individual leaves (Vogel 1989) to whole tree crowns (Kane et al. 2008)—perturbs the airflow inside forest canopies (Shaw et al. 1974; Baldocchi and Meyers 1988; Turnipseed et al. 2003). Therefore, detailed information on forest structure is an essential precondition for understanding wind–tree interactions and the successful application of flow models to tall canopies. In flow models, forest struc-ture is often represented by the mean vertical profile of the plant area density. Queck et al. (2011, this issue) present a method that can be used to record detailed 3D stand structure from terrestrial laser scanning. They investigated the relationship between wind speed, aerodynamic drag, and plant area density and show how 3D laser scanner data can be used to derive turbulence parameters for flow models. The structure of windward forest edges (Mitscherlich 1973; Dupont and Brunet 2008a, b) as well as the stand structure (Gardiner et al. 1997; Marcolla et al. 2003; Dupont and Brunet 2008b, c; Queck and Bernhofer 2010) affects the flow field within and above forests. In the near-edge region, pronounced gradients of flow quantities pro-voke high wind load on trees (Stacey et al. 1994; Peltola 1996; Gardiner et al. 1997), which may trigger damage in strong wind conditions. Although Gardiner and Stacey (1996) as well as Dupont and Brunet (2008a) report that tapered forest edges reduce wind loading and related bending moments of trees near the edge, it is still not completely clear, how changes in edge and stand structure affect the flow field at the canopy near forest edges, and whether these changes can contribute to the mitigation of damage in high wind conditions. In a detailed wind tunnel study, Ruck et al. (2011, this issue) investigated the effect of changes in taper angle of windward forest edges on the flow field for different stand densities. Their results dem-onstrate the impact of edge shape and stand density on quantities of the flow field near the canopy top, the region most relevant for tree failure in strong wind conditions. The aerial parts of trees start to vibrate in response to wind excitation (Sellier and Fourcaud 2005; Rodriguez et al. 2008). In forests, dynamic tree responses are not only observed at the single tree level (Mayer 1987; Gardiner 1995; Peltola 1996; Flesch and Wilson 1999; Rudnicki et al. 2008; Schindler et al. 2010) but also at the tree group level (Rudnicki et al. 2001, 2003; Schindler et al. 2011, this issue). At both levels, the resulting tree response patterns are complex and complicated.

abstract = {The ongoing mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has reached epidemic proportions, with the beetle expanding into geographic areas outside its known biological range. In this study, estimates of red attack damage were derived from a logistic regression model using multi-date Landsat imagery, and ancillary information including terrain attributes and solar radiation. The model estimates were found to be approximately 70{\%} accurate using an independent set of beetle survey data as validation. This probability surface of red attack damage, along with forest inventory and terrain attributes, were used as inputs to decision tree analyses, in order to identify which forest attributes were associated with stands that had a greater likelihood of mountain pine beetle red attack damage. Three distinct decision tree models were developed, with each having a different set of input variables. The results of the analyses indicated that site index (an indicator of the quality of a forest site) and slope were the principal discriminators of the current mountain pine beetle attack, followed by basal area of pine dominated stands, and to a lesser extent, crown closure and stem density. The results suggest that indicators of site quality, particularly site index, could be a complementary addition to existing stand susceptibility rating models. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {High spatial resolution remotely sensed data has the potential to complement existing forest health programs for both strategic planning over large areas, as well as for detailed and precise identification of tree crowns subject to stress and infestation. The area impacted by the current mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has increased 40-fold over the previous 5 years, with approximately 8.5 million ha of forest infested in 2005. As a result of the spatial extent and intensity of the outbreak, new technologies are being assessed to help detect, map, and monitor the damage caused by the beetle, and to inform mitigation of future beetle outbreaks. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of high spatial resolution QuickBird multi-spectral imagery to detect mountain pine beetle red attack damage. ANOVA testing of individual spectral bands, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a ratio of red to green reflectance (Red-Green Index or RGI), indicated that the RGI was the most successful (p {\textless} 0.001) at separating non-attack crowns from red attack crowns. Based on this result, the RGI was subsequently used to develop a binary classification of red attack and non-attack pixels. The total number of QuickBird pixels classified as having red attack damage within a 50 m buffer of a known forest health survey point were compared to the number of red attack trees recorded at the time of the forest health survey. The relationship between the number of red attack pixels and observed red attack crowns was assessed using independent validation data and was found to be significant (r2 = 0.48, p {\textless} 0.001, standard error = 2.8 crowns). A comparison of the number of QuickBird pixels classified as red attack, and a broader scale index of mountain pine beetle red attack damage (Enhanced Wetness Difference Index, calculated from a time series of Landsat imagery), was significant (r2 = 0.61, p {\textless} 0.001, standard error = 1.3 crowns). These results suggest that high spatial resolution imagery, in particular QuickBird satellite imagery, has a valuable role to play in identifying tree crowns with red attack damage. This information could subsequently be used to augment existing detailed forest health surveys, calibrate synoptic estimates of red attack damage generated from overview surveys and/or coarse scale remotely sensed data, and facilitate the generation of value-added information products, such as estimates of timber volume impacts at the forest stand level. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The more humid, warmer weather pattern predicted for the future is expected to increase the windthrow risk of trees through reduced tree anchorage due to a decrease in soil freezing between late autumn and early spring, i.e during the most windy months of the year. In this context, the present study aimed at calculating how a potential increase of up to 4 • C in mean annual temperature might modify the duration of soil frost and the depth of frozen soil in forests and consequently increase the risk of windthrow. The risk was evaluated by combining the simulated critical windspeeds needed to uproot Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) under unfrozen soil conditions with the possible change in the frequency of these winds during the unfrozen period. The evaluation of the impacts of elevated temperature on the frequency of these winds at times of unfrozen and frozen soil conditions was based on monthly wind speed statistics for the years 1961-1990 (Meteorological Yearbooks of Finland, 1961-1990). Frost simulations in a Scots pine stand growing on a moraine sandy soil (height 20 m, stand density 800 stems ha −1) showed that the duration of soil frost will decrease from 4-5 months to 2-3 months per year in southern Finland and from 5-6 months to 4-5 months in northern Finland given a temperature elevation of 4 • C. In addition, it could decrease substantially more in the deeper soil layers (40-60 cm) than near the surface (0-20 cm), particularly in southern Finland. Consequently, tree anchorage may lose much of the additional support gained at present from the frozen soil in winter, making Scots pines more liable to windthrow during winter and spring storms. Critical wind-speed simulations showed mean winds of 11-15 m s −1 to be enough to uproot Scots pines under unfrozen soil conditions, i.e. especially slender trees with a high height to breast height diameter ratio (taper of 1:120 and 1:100). In the future, as many as 80{\%} of these mean winds of 11-15 m s −1 would occur during months when the soil is unfrozen in southern Finland, whereas the corresponding proportion at present is about 55{\%}. In northern Finland, the percentage is 40{\%} today and is expected to be 50{\%} in the future. Thus, as the strongest winds usually occur between late autumn and early spring, climate change could increase the loss of standing timber through windthrow, especially in southern Finland.},

abstract = {Windthrow is a recurring disturbance process in regions that are influenced by maritime climates, including boreal forests. Within the circumboreal region, forest management approaches have been adapted to emulate natural disturbance in order to promote biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. Few studies have evaluated windthrow outcomes in natural or managed old-growth boreal mixed-species stands, and these studies are primarily empirical. The objective of this study was to adapt the hybrid empirical-mechanistic ForestGALES{\_}BC model, to investigate windthrow dynamics in natural and managed boreal old-growth stands, under various wind regimes. ForestGALES{\_}BC was updated by adding biomechanical data for balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.). The model has the ability to simulate damage propagation during wind events by recalculating wind loading on a subject tree after failure of upwind trees. The number of iterations of this recalculation provides insights into the potential for propagation during longer duration storms. A simulation space made up of 500, 20 m × 20 m cells, was created using tree-lists from silviculture systems experiments in north eastern Quebec. The tree-lists for cells within the simulation space were edited to represent the plot conditions at the Quebec experimental sites, allowing simulation of a range of cell- (plot) and matrix-level (landscape) partial harvesting regimes. Above-canopy winds of various speeds were applied in order to test the initiation and propagation of damage within the simulated forest. Simulated outcomes were compared to observations of windthrow 6-7 years after partial harvesting at the field experimental site. Observed damage at the experimental site ranged from 1 to 40{\%} of plot total basal area (mean = 14{\%}, se = 1.96). For above-canopy wind speeds within the range expected for the experimental site, simulated windthrow levels in partial cuts ranged from 7 to 32{\%} (mean = 12{\%}, se = 1.94). When the combined effects of wind speed and number of iterations ({\~{}}event duration) were investigated, event duration was more important for wind speeds over 20 m/s. By enabling simulation of outcomes at the tree, plot (cell) and stand (simulation space) levels, the model allows investigation of a wide range of harvesting strategies, and sets the stage for inclusion of wind disturbance in ecosystem succession models and other stand or landscape-level decision-support tools for forests in windy climates.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to increase the basic understanding of outbreak dynamics in order to improve the management of bark beetle outbreaks. The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is a major disturbance agent of European forests and is the continent's most economically and environmentally damaging bark beetle. Outbreaks of the spruce bark beetle are often triggered by large windfall episodes, and we have utilized a unique opportunity to study a Slovakian outbreak where little salvage logging was performed in some areas after a 2.5 million m3 storm-felling in 2004.Our analyses focused on the first five years after the windfall, and we used a combination of empirical data and simulation models to understand the spatial patterns of beetle-killed forest patches developing during the outbreak. The univoltine beetle population used an increasing proportion of the windfelled trees during the two first seasons after the storm, but from the third season onwards our comparisons of inter-patch distance distributions indicated a transition from beetle production largely in windfall areas to a self-sustaining outbreak with infestation patches developing independently of the windthrows. The size of new infestation patches formed after this transition was modeled as a function of beetle pressure, estimated by the proportion of a circle area surrounding new patches that was covered by infestation patches the previous year. Our model results of patch size distribution did not correspond well with the empirical data if patch formation was modeled as a pure dispersal-diffusion process. However, beetle aggregation on individual trees appears to be important for patch development, since good correspondence with empirical data was found when beetle aggregation was incorporated in the modeled dispersal process. The strength of correspondence between the beetle aggregation model and the empirical data varied with the density of aggregation trees in the modeled landscape, and reached a maximum of 83{\%} for a density of three aggregation trees per infestation patch.Our results suggest that efficient removal of windfelled trees up until the start of the second summer after a major windfall is important to avoid a transition into a patch-driven bark beetle outbreak that is very difficult to manage. Our results also indicate that the outcome of a patch-driven outbreak is difficult to predict, since the development of new infestation patches is not a simple function of beetle pressure but is also affected by beetle behavior and local forest conditions.},

The present paper reviews recent work on the relationship between conifer resistance to bark beetle attack and tree vigor, e.g. in terms of wood production per unit of foliage. Experimental studies in the Pacific Northwest and the southeast U.S.A., and in Norway, are drawn upon to show that tree resistance to attack may be closely related to the amount of current and stored photosynthate that is available for defense. An experimental approach is advocated to critically test the relationship between host-tree resistance and the limitations on the transfer of critical resources to the site of attack.},

abstract = {A highly automated algorithm called vegetation change tracker (VCT) has been developed for reconstructing recent forest disturbance history using Landsat time series stacks (LTSS). This algorithm is based on the spectral-temporal properties of land cover and forest change processes, and requires little or no fine tuning for most forests with closed or near close canopy cover. It was found very efficient, taking 2-3 h on average to analyze an LTSS consisting of 12 or more Landsat images using an average desktop PC. This LTSS-VCT approach has been used to examine disturbance patterns with a biennial temporal interval from 1984 to 2006 for many locations across the conterminous U.S. Accuracy assessment over 6 validation sites revealed that overall accuracies of around 80{\%} were achieved for disturbances mapped at individual year level. Average user's and producer's accuracies of the disturbance classes were around 70{\%} and 60{\%} in 5 of the 6 sites, respectively, suggesting that although forest disturbances were typically rare as compared with no-change classes, on average the VCT detected more than half of those disturbances with relatively low levels of false alarms. Field assessment revealed that VCT was able to detect most stand clearing disturbance events, including harvest, fire, and urban development, while some non-stand clearing events such as thinning and selective logging were also mapped in western U.S. The applicability of the LTSS-VCT approach depends on the availability of a temporally adequate supply of Landsat imagery. To ensure that forest disturbance records can be developed continuously in the future, it is necessary to plan and develop observational capabilities today that will allow continuous acquisition of frequent Landsat or Landsat-like observations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The ongoing climate change can influence the dynamic of insect populations and therefore the Insect species Responsible for Forest Damage (“insects-RFD” hereafter). The present study aims at identifying the most occurring insects-RFD in Sweden, and exploring the relationships between insects-RFD and climate and land management changes. The recorded insect attacks based on historical reports, literature and databases, were collected for North, Central and South of Sweden, and for two periods at yearly time scales: 1850–1950 and 1961–2014. A series of analyses has been carried out based on this dataset: 1-Estimation of the occurrence of each insects-RFD over years to assess which insect species have caused the major forest damage, 2-Ratios of broadleaved versus conifer host trees to estimate the main types of damaged forests, and 3-Canonical correspondence analyses to evaluate how much climate (winter and summer temperature, winter and summer precipitation, and storms) and land management (land areas for wood production, standing volume for all trees and standing volume for deciduous trees) changes have affected insects-RFD. The results reveal that the most occurring insects-RFD differ between the North and South of Sweden, and between 1850–1950 and 1961–2014. The most occurring insects-RFD since 1850 were Ips typographus, Neodiprion sertifer, Tortrix viridana, Hylobius abietis and Tomicus piniperda. The occurrences of insects-RFD have been higher in the South of Sweden since at least 1850 than in other regions. The North of Sweden have been mostly affected by insects-RFD between 1911 and 1950. Canonical correspondence analyses show that the spread of insects-RFD might be related to environmental conditions. More particularly, the insects-RFD variation explained are increasing between 1902–1950 and 1961–2007 in all Sweden for temperature (winter and summer) and in Central and South of Sweden for storm damage. However, the evolution of landscape management would participate in influencing insects-RFD, in particular from 1961, when changes in forest management (e.g. increase in land areas for wood production) have been developed, as well as the way to report insect forest damages. This long-term perspective of how changes in climate and land management have influenced insects-RFD is of great interest for further discussion about climate adaptation strategies in forestry and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Biological infestations in forests, e.g. the insect outbreaks, have been shown as favoured by future climate change trends. In Europe, the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) is one of the main agents causing substantial economic disturbances in forests. Therefore, studies on spatio-temporal characterization of the area affected by bark beetle are of major importance for rapid post-attack management. We aimed at spatially detecting damage classes by combining multidate remote sensing data and a non-parametric classification. As study site served a part of the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany). For the analysis, we used 10 geometrically rectified scenes of Landsat and SPOT sensors in the period between 2001 and 2011. The main objective was to explore the potential of medium-resolution data for classifying the attacked areas. A further aim was to explore if the temporally adjacent infested areas are able to be separated. The random forest (RF) model was applied using the reference data drawn from high-resolution aerial imagery. The results indicate that the sufficiently large patches of visually identifiable damage classes can be accurately separated from non-attacked areas. In contrast to those, the other mortality classes (current year, current year 1 and current year 2 infested classes) were mostly classified with higher commission or omission errors as well as higher classification biases. The available medium-resolution satellite images, combined with properly acquired reference data, are concluded to be adequate tools to map area-based infestations at advanced stages. However, the quality of reference data, the size of infested patches and the spectral resolution of remotely sensed data are the decisive factors in case of smaller areas. Further attempts using auxiliary height information and spatially enhanced data may refine such an approach.},

It has been observed that the drought phenomenon has severe impacts on the agriculture, hydrology, social, and economic sectors of lowland areas. This study focuses on how drought, defined as a precipitation shortage, occurs in higher altitudes of the Tatra National Park (Tatra Mts., Slovakia), which is a significant biological reserve of the Central European fauna and flora. The main goals of this research include identifying drought variability and its characteristics over the Tatra National Park in the West Carpathians (Slovakia), especially to characterizing drought variability and its spatial pattern across the Tatra National Park from 1961 to 2010 using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and standard Geographic Information System (GIS) methods. The results showed that frequency of drought occurrence has cyclic pattern with approximately 30-year period. The spatial analyses showed that precipitation shadow of the mountains influences the risk of drought occurrence. The drought-prone areas over the mountains are also identified.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Bernes et al. Background: The biodiversity of forests set aside from forestry is often considered best preserved by non-intervention. In many protected forests, however, remaining biodiversity values are legacies of past disturbances, e.g. recurring fires, grazing or small-scale felling. These forests may need active management to keep the characteristics that were the reason for setting them aside. Such management can be particularly relevant where lost ecological values need to be restored. In this review, we identified studies on a variety of interventions that could be useful for conserving or restoring any aspect of forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. Since the review is based on Swedish initiatives, we have focused on forest types that are represented in Sweden, but such forests exist in many parts of the world. The wide scope of the review means that the set of studies is quite heterogeneous. As a first step towards a more complete synthesis, therefore, we have compiled a systematic map. Such a map gives an overview of the evidence base by providing a database with descriptions of relevant studies, but it does not synthesise reported results. Methods: Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, French, German, Russian and Swedish. We searched not only for studies of interventions in actual forest set-asides, but also for appropriate evidence from commercially managed forests, since some practices applied there may be useful for conservation or restoration purposes too. Identified articles were screened for relevance using criteria set out in an a priori protocol. Descriptions of included studies are available in an Excel file, and also in an interactive GIS application that can be accessed at an external website. Results: Our searches identified nearly 17,000 articles. The 798 articles that remained after screening for relevance described 812 individual studies. Almost two-thirds of the included studies were conducted in North America, whereas most of the rest were performed in Europe. Of the European studies, 58 {\%} were conducted in Finland or Sweden. The interventions most commonly studied were partial harvesting, prescribed burning, thinning, and grazing or exclusion from grazing. The outcomes most frequently reported were effects of interventions on trees, other vascular plants, dead wood, vertical stand structure and birds. Outcome metrics included e.g. abundance, richness of species (or genera), diversity indices, and community composition based on ordinations. Conclusions: This systematic map identifies a wealth of evidence on the impact of active management practices that could be utilised to conserve or restore biodiversity in forest set-asides. As such it should be of value to e.g. conservation managers, researchers and policymakers. Moreover, since the map also highlights important knowledge gaps, it could inspire new primary research on topics that have so far not been well covered. Finally, it provides a foundation for systematic reviews on specific subtopics. Based on our map of the evidence, we identified four subtopics that are sufficiently covered by existing studies to allow full systematic reviewing, potentially including meta-analysis.},

abstract = {The impact of natural enemies on tile reproduction and survival of Ips typographus japonicus Niijima in Hokkaido was tested by sequentially caging off cohorts of a single beetle generation sc as to investigate the effects of natural enemies at different developmental stages. A consistent increase in mortality of between 17-18{\%} in the first 2-3 weeks of exposure to natural enemies was observed, after which mortality remained relatively constant. Natural enemies which were found to occur in logs exposed during this time were the predators Medetera sp., Thanasimus substriatus, and the adult parasitoid Tomicobia watanabei. Of these, only the first two were found to be significantly associated with beetle brood mortality. However, a confounding factor was the fact that beetle density also significantly increased in logs during the period when mortality was increasing. It was found that larval mine density, and hence intraspecific mortality, was the single most important factor correlated with beetle mortality during this period. It was thus concluded that increased intraspecific competition was responsible for most of the increase in mortality during the first 2-3 weeks exposure, with predators playing a more minor role. Parasitoids were observed to occur in logs late in the exposure period when mortality was relatively constant and so appeared to have little effect on beetle reproduction and survival. The results of this study were compared to results from similar previous exclusion experiments with bark beetles and the fact that beetle density-dependent effects as a mortality factor was not considered in many of these studies noted. It is therefore suggested that some of these previous studies may have overestimated the importance of natural enemies and associates as mortality factors and subsequently underestimated the importance of intraspecific competition. Suggestions are made to improve bark beetle exclusion methodology so as to remove the confounding factor of beetle density from the analysis},

abstract = {Forest biomass is a major store of carbon and thus plays an important role in the regional and global carbon cycle. Accurate forest carbon sequestration assessment requires estimation of both forest biomass and forest biomass dynamics over time. Forest dynamics are characterized by disturbances and recovery, key processes affecting site productivity and the forest carbon cycle. Thus, spatially and temporally explicit knowledge of these processes and their drivers are critical for understanding regional carbon cycles. Here, we present a new method that uses satellite data to estimate changes in forest aboveground biomass associated with forest disturbances and recovery at annual time steps. First, yearly maps of aboveground biomass between 1985 and 2010 based on Landsat time series and field data were created. Then, we applied a trajectory-based segmentation and fitting algorithm to the yearly biomass maps to reconstruct the forest disturbance and recovery history over the last 25. years.We tested the method over a coniferous forest region in the Western Carpathian Mountains, which experienced long-term environmental changes. Overall, 55{\%} ({\~{}} 30,700. ha) of the total coniferous forest experienced a loss of biomass over the observation period, while {\~{}}. 30{\%} showed severe or complete removal of forest biomass. At the same time, 11.2{\%} of the area was reforested or regenerated on previously damaged forest stands. The total coniferous biomass dropped by 15{\%} between 1985 and 2010, indicating negative balance between the losses and the gains. Disturbance hotspots indicate high insect infestation levels in many areas and reveal strong interactions between biomass loss and climate conditions. Our study demonstrates how spatial and temporal estimates of biomass help to understand regional forest dynamics and derive degradation trends in regard to regional climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Forests in Europe and North America are being affected by large and severe outbreaks of bark beetles, which have caused widespread concern about forest health and have led to proposals for tree removal in affected or susceptible forests. Any such intervention, as well as broader decisions of whether any active interventions are appropriate, should be based on the best scientific data. This is true for all forests, including those whose purposes include timber production, watershed protection, biogeochemical function and recreation, and especially protected and conservation areas as the latter often provide particularly unique and important cultural, social, scientific and other ecosystem services. Here, I summarize peer-reviewed literature on the effects of bark beetle outbreaks and on silvicultural treatments aimed at mitigating beetle-induced tree mortality. From an objective scientific perspective, beetle outbreaks do not destroy forests. Instead, in many cases they play an important role in promoting wildlife, biodiversity and other ecological services. The best available data indicate that logging in conservation areas is unlikely to stop ongoing bark beetle outbreaks and instead may be more ecologically detrimental to the forests than the outbreaks themselves. If the purpose of a forest is timber production, then logging is desirable and can be planned based on appropriate analyses of timber yield and economic profit. However, in areas in which conservation is the determined goal, it is recommended that cutting trees be limited to removing hazards, such as trees that might fall in areas of high human activity in order to limit property damage and personal injury. Based on extensive research in Europe and North America, logging beetle-affected forests is inconsistent with most conservation goals.},

abstract = {Forest management consists in anthropogenic disturbances that are able to modulate ecological features, resource availability and successional patterns. Plant communities are thus expected to react differently to contrasted silvicultural systems. We compared plant species composition between stands submitted to a traditional management since many centuries (i.e. coppice-with-standards treatment, stands intensively but infrequently disturbed) and stands recently converted into a selective cutting system (stands moderately but frequently disturbed), over uniform edaphic and topographic conditions. We found significant differences in species composition between both systems. Despite a strong shift in species composition among different stages of the coppice cycle, coppice-with-standards stands supported the highest number of true forest species. Selectively-cut stands were more homogeneous and characterized by ruderal "generalist" species. These fast changes in vegetation composition were related to differences in a group of factors that are directly or indirectly linked to the silviculture-associated disturbance regime, including soil moisture, soil fertility, forest microclimate, light and game predation. We conclude that the conversion of a silvicultural system which has patterned plant communities since many centuries, induces early major changes in vegetation composition. The most negatively impacted species are the so-called "true forest species" that may be better labelled "coppice-woodland species". {\textcopyright} INRA, EDP Sciences, 2005.},

We focus particularly on the hybrid mechanistic/empirical models GALES and HWIND, which have been designed for calculating wind damage risk at the stand level within uniform forests and which are the most widely adopted models within the research community. These models have been integrated with different methods for predicting the local wind climate in order to calculate the probability of wind damage in a number of different countries. We also discuss ongoing modelling work and proposals for future development in order to deal with complex forest structures and to predict the wind damage risk of individual trees within stands through the integration of mechanistic risk models with forest growth and yield models within a geographical information system framework. This kind of model integration will enable spatial representation of tree lists and damage propagation and allow managers to evaluate the effect of different harvesting and thinning scenarios on the risk of windthrow of both stands and individual trees within a stand.},

abstract = {Snow and wind damages are one of the major abiotic disturbances playing a major role in forest ecosystems and affecting both stand dynamics and forest management decisions. This study analyses the occurrence of wind and snow damage on Norwegian forests, based on data from four consecutive forest inventories (1995–2014). The methodological approach is based on boosted regression trees, a machine learning method aiming to demonstrate the effects of different variables on damage probability and their interactions as well as to spatialize damage occurrence to make predictions. In total, 313 models are fitted to detect trends, interactions and effects among the variables. The main variables associated with damage occurrence are consistent across all the models and include: latitude, altitude and slope (related to site and location), and tree density, mean diameter and height (related to forest characteristics). The results show that stand dominant height is a key variable in explaining damage probability, whereas stand slenderness has a limited effect. More heterogeneous forest structures make birch dominated stands more resistant to damage. Finally, the models are translated into occurrence maps, to provide landscape-level information on snow and wind damage hazard. Further application of the models can be oriented towards assessing the probability of damage for alternate stand management scenarios.},

abstract = {In response to the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, habitat network conservation and restoration has become a central objective in conservation planning. Evaluating landscape functional connectivity and mapping habitat networks are key steps for implementing effective actions, but both remain challenging. Habitat suitability models (HSM) and spatial graphs provide conservation managers with useful information for landscape planning. To tackle their respective drawbacks, we proposed to combine HSM and spatial graphs in a four-step methodological framework: (i) collect and prepare input data; (ii) model habitat suitability using MaxEnt to map the species' habitat suitability index (HSI); (iii) transform the HSI map into spatial graph inputs using GIS; and, (iv) perform spatial graph connectivity analysis using Graphab. The outputs of this species-specific and quantitative approach were maps of the species' habitat network. Habitat patches and dispersal linkages were ranked according to their importance for overall habitat availability and landscape connectivity. This prioritization identified locations where conservation biologists and landscape planners should focus conservation and restoration efforts. This framework is illustrated here with a case study on the woodlark (Lullula arborea) - a bird species - in a French Mediterranean area, and the method's limitations and alternatives are discussed. The quantitative-based graphical outputs of the framework can valuably support decision-making for landscape planning, complement local expert opinion, and encourage appropriate stakeholders to cooperate at regional scale.},

abstract = {The 193-Member United Nations General Assembly today formally adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, along with a set of bold new Global Goals, which Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed as a universal, integrated and transformative vision for a better world. “The new agenda is a promise by leaders to all people everywhere. It is an agenda for people, to end poverty in all its forms – an agenda for the planet, our common home,” declared Mr. Ban as he opened the UN Sustainable Development Summit which kicked off today and wraps up Sunday. The UN chief's address came ahead of the Assembly's formal adoption of the new framework, Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is composed of 17 goals and 169 targets to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate over the next 15 years. The Goals aim to build on the work of the historic Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which in September 2000, rallied the world around a common 15-year agenda to tackle the indignity of poverty. The Summit opened with a full programme of events, including a screening of the film The Earth From Space, performances by UN Goodwill Ambassadors Shakira Angelique Kidjo, as well as call to action by female education advocate and the youngest-ever Nobel Laureate, Malala Yousafzai along with youth representatives as torch bearers to a sustainable future. The adoption ceremony was presided over by Danish Prime Minister Lars L{\o}kke Rasmussen and Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who stressed the successes of the MDGSs and the need for the full implementation of the new Agenda. Speaking to the press after the adoption of the Agenda, Mr. Ban said: “These Goals are a blueprint for a better future. Now we must use the goals to transform the world. We will do that through partnership and through commitment. We must leave no-one behind. In his opening address to the Assembly, which also marks the Organization's 70th anniversary, the UN chief hailed the new framework as an agenda for shared prosperity, peace and partnership. “It conveys the urgency of climate action. It is rooted in gender equality and respect for the rights of all.” Mr. Ban urged the world leaders and others convened at the event to successfully implement the Global Goals or Agenda 30 by launching ‘renewed global partnership.' “The 2030 Agenda compels us to look beyond national boundaries and short-term interests and act in solidarity for the long-term. We can no longer afford to think and work in silos. Institutions will have to become fit for a grand new purpose. The United Nations system is strongly committed to supporting Member States in this great new endeavour,” said Mr. Ban. “We must engage all actors, as we did in shaping the Agenda. We must include parliaments and local governments, and work with cities and rural areas. We must rally businesses and entrepreneurs. We must involve civil society in defining and implementing policies – and give it the space to hold us to account. We must listen to scientists and academia. We will need to embrace a data revolution. Most important, we must set to work – now,” added the Secretary-General. “Seventy years ago, the United Nations rose from the ashes of war. Governments agreed on a visionary Charter dedicated to ‘We the Peoples'. The Agenda you are adopting today advances the goals of the Charter. It embodies the aspirations of people everywhere for lives of peace, security and dignity on a healthy planet,” said Mr. Ban. General Assembly President Mogens Lykketoft called the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development “ambitious” in confronting the injustices of poverty, marginalization and discrimination. “We recognize the need to reduce inequalities and to protect our common home by changing unsustainable patterns of consumption and production. And, we identify the overwhelming need to address the politics of division, corruption and irresponsibility that fuel conflict and hold back development,” he said. On the adoption of the new agenda, UN Economic and Social Council President (ECOSOC) Oh Joon said action on Sustainable Development Goals must start immediately. “The Economic and Social Council stands ready to kick-start the work on the new agenda,” he added.

Feedbacks between vegetation and fire may modify the direct effects of warming on fire activity and shape ecological responses to changing fire frequency. We investigate these interactions using extensive field data from the Boreal Shield of Saskatchewan, Canada, a region where {\textgreater}40{\%} of the forest has burned in the past 30 years. We use geospatial and field data to assess the resistance and resilience of eight common vegetation states to frequent fire by quantifying the occurrence of short‐interval fires and their effect on recovery to a similar vegetation state. These empirical relationships are combined with data from published literature to parameterize a spatially explicit, state‐and‐transition simulation model of fire and forest succession. We use this model to ask if and how: (1) feedbacks between vegetation and wildfire may modify fire activity on the landscape and (2) more frequent fire may affect landscape forest composition and age structure. Both field and GIS data suggest the probability of fire is low in the initial decades after fire, supporting the hypothesis that fuel accumulation may exert a negative feedback on fire frequency. Field observations of pre‐ and post‐fire composition indicate that switches in forest state are more likely in conifer stands that burn at a young age, supporting the hypothesis that resilience is lower in immature stands. Stands dominated by deciduous trees or jack pine were generally resilient to fire, while mixed conifer and well‐drained spruce forests were less resilient. However, simulation modeling suggests increased fire activity may result in large changes in forest age structure and composition, despite the feedbacks between vegetation‐fire likely to occur with increased fire activity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Abstract The impact of disturbances on boreal forest plant communities is not fully understood, particularly when different disturbances are combined, and regime shifts to alternate stable states are possible after disturbance. A long-term monitored semi-natural forest site subject to intense combined storm and bark beetle damage beginning in 2005 provided an opportunity to investigate the postdisturbance development of the vegetation community. Previous studies suggest that a shift from Picea abies to Fagus sylvatica domination was possible. We analyzed pre- and postdisturbance vegetation data to investigate to what extent vascular plant species abundances, diversity, traits, and community composition have changed. We were particularly interested in differences between remaining apparently unaffected areas (potential refugia) and disturbed areas, and in signs of consistent change over time in community composition in response to disturbance that could indicate an impending regime shift. We found that the vegetation community present in the refuge areas has remained substantially intact through the period of disturbance. Nonrefuge areas diverged from the refuges in community composition and showed increased taxonomic and functional diversity. Despite this, and an increase in deciduous tree species (particularly F. sylvatica), P. abies has shown strong postdisturbance regeneration. The refuges may be important in the apparent ongoing recovery of the disturbed areas to a P. abies-dominated state similar to that found predisturbance. This fast recovery is interpreted as evidence of a system resilient to a potential shift to a deciduous-dominated state. Synthesis: Our results show that even powerful combined disturbances in a system with multiple stable states can be insufficient to initiate a regime shift. Resilience of the P. abies-dominated forest community is increased by the survival of refuge areas functioning as a form of ecological memory of the previous ecosystem state. The results also demonstrate the value of data generated by long-term monitoring programs.},

The volume of wood that could not be felled in the protected areas was assessed firstly by estimating unconstrained felling potentials by disregarding all forms of protection or limitations to mobilize these resources. The felling potentials were assumed to be equal to the average net annual increment, because fellings should not generally exceed increment to assure long-term sustainability. The felling restrictions imposed on protected forest areas varied considerably across Europe. On average, 48{\%} of the volume cannot be felled in forest areas protected for biodiversity and 40{\%} in forests protected for landscapes.

abstract = {Storms represent the most important disturbance factor in forests of Central Europe. Using data from long-term growth and yield experiments in Baden-Wuerttemberg (south-western Germany), which permit separation of storm damage from other causes of mortality for individual trees, we investigated the influence of soil, site, forest stand, and tree parameters on storm damage, especially focusing on the influence of silvicultural interventions. For this purpose, a four-step modeling approach was applied in order to extract the main risk factors for (1) the general stand-level occurrence of storm damage, (2) the occurrence of total stand damage, and (3) partial storm damage within stands. The estimated stand-level probability of storm damage obtained in step 3 was then offset in order to describe the damage potential for the individual trees within each partially damaged stand (4). Generalized linear mixed models were applied. Our results indicate that tree species and stand height are the most important storm risk factors, also for characterizing the long-term storm risk. Additionally, data on past timber removals and selective thinnings appear more important for explaining storm damage predisposition than for example stand density, soil and site conditions or topographic variables. When quantified with a weighting method (summarizing the relative weight of single predictors or groups of predictors), removals could explain up to 20{\%} of storm risk. The stepwise modeling approach proved an important methodological feature of the analysis, since it enabled consideration of the large number of observations without damage ("zero inflation") in a statistically correct way. These results form a reliable basis for quantifying forest management's direct impact on the risk of storm damage. ? 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Since the 1997 H5N1 influenza virus outbreak in humans and poultry in Hong Kong, the emergence of closely related viruses in poultry has raised concerns that additional zoonotic transmissions of influenza viruses from poultry to humans may occur. In May 2001, an avian H5N1 influenza A virus was isolated from duck meat that had been imported to South Korea from China. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of A/Duck/Anyang/AVL-1/01 showed that the virus clustered with the H5 Goose/Guandong/1/96 lineage and 1997 Hong Kong human isolates and possessed an HA cleavage site sequence identical to these isolates. Following intravenous or intranasal inoculation, this virus was highly pathogenic and replicated to high titers in chickens. The pathogenesis of DK/Anyang/AVL-1/01 virus in Pekin ducks was further characterized and compared with a recent H5N1 isolate, A/Chicken/Hong Kong/317.5/01, and an H5N1 1997 chicken isolate, A/Chicken/Hong Kong/220/97. Although no clinical signs of disease were observed in H5N1 virus-inoculated ducks, infectious virus could be detected in lung tissue, cloacal, and oropharyngeal swabs. The DK/Anyang/AVL-1/01 virus was unique among the H5N1 isolates in that infectious virus and viral antigen could also be detected in muscle and brain tissue of ducks. The pathogenesis of DK/Anyang/AVL-1/01 virus was characterized in BALB/c mice and compared with the other H5N1 isolates. All viruses replicated in mice, but in contrast to the highly lethal CK/HK/220/97 virus, DK/Anyang/AVL-1/01 and CK/HK/317.5/01 viruses remained localized to the respiratory tract. DK/Anyang/AVL-1/01 virus caused weight loss and resulted in 22 to 33{\%} mortality, whereas CK/HK/317.5/01-infected mice exhibited no morbidity or mortality. The isolation of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus from poultry indicates that such viruses are still circulating in China and may present a risk for transmission of the virus to humans.},

abstract = {In Canada and elsewhere, logging practices in natural-origin forests
have shifted toward retention systems where variable levels of mature
trees are retained post-logging to promote a diversity of values. We
examine multiple sites that experienced a wide range of prior harvest
regimes (0-76{\%} basal area removal) to evaluate how harvest intensity
and proximity to a logging-created edge affects susceptibility to
windthrow for a suite of tree species in complex-structured mature and
old-growth mixed-species stand types in British Columbia. We found no
increased susceptibility to windthrow as a function of the level of
partial harvesting. We observed a reduced susceptibility to windthrow of
smaller trees after partial harvesting. There were clear differences in
susceptibility to windthrow among different tree species close to the
edge of gaps and small openings ({\textless}1 ha in size) created by partial
harvesting. Hemlock and redcedar, the two most common trees species,
were unaffected by edge environments, whereas the less common conifers
and deciduous species were more susceptible to windthrow along partial
harvest edges. This suggests tree-marking guidelines should remove the
species most prone to windthrow from edges around small openings in
these forest types. Our study and others suggest use of retention
systems in structurally diverse, multi-species forests does not lead to
elevated risk of windthrow, especially if retention levels exceed
20-30{\%}.},

abstract = {Aim of this paper is to present the remote sensing-based systems of
forest health assessment in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and to
analyse both their strengths and weaknesses. Nationwide assessment of
forest health in the Czech Republic is based on the interpretation of
Sentinel-2 satellite data using novel approaches for cloud-free image
synthesis based on all available satellite observations. A predictive
statistical model to yield time series of leaf area index (LAI) from
satellite observations is developed above extensive in-situ data,
including {\{}[{\}}Al and forest defoliation assessment. Forest health is
evaluated for each pixel from yearly changes of forest LAI, while the
country-wise assessment of the health status is performed at the
cadastral level. Methodology developed for Slovakia is based on a
two-phase regression sampling. The first phase of the procedure provides
an initial fast estimate of forest damage using only satellite
observations (visible and infrared channels from Landsat or Sentinel-2
systems). The second phase refines the result of the first phase using
data from a ground damage assessment (site-level defoliation from ICP
Forests database). Resulting forest health assessment over the whole
forest area is presented in 10 defoliation classes. The Czech Republic
shows 1.6{\%} of heavily damaged forests, 12.5{\%} of damaged forests,
79.2{\%} of forests with stable conditions, 6.3{\%} of regenerated forests
and 0.4{\%} of strongly regenerated forests. In Slovakia, the total share
of damaged stands (i. e. with defoliation higher than 40{\%}) increased
from 6 - 8{\%} in 2003 - 2011 to 13 - 15{\%} in 2012-2017. Both
methodologies conduct nationwide assessment of forest health status in a
fast and automatized way with high accuracy and minimal costs. The
weaknesses are, for example, a high computational demands for production
cloud free mosaics, inability to identify initial phases of forest
health decline, exclusion of stands older than 80 years (in the Czech
Republic) and inability to differentiate between harvested and severely
damaged stands (in Slovakia). Finally, the paper outlines future
development of both methodologies.},

abstract = {Important influences of burrowing animals on ecosystems are reported from several environments. However, the impact of burrowing on alpine meadows has only been poorly studied. The largest and most widespread burrowing animals living in an alpine region are marmots. We tried to answer the following questions: Do marmots cause structural and compositional changes in alpine plant communities? Do marmots have a significant effect on soil properties? Do vegetation types differ according to their dependency on the functional utilization of the burrow? On a colony scale marmots significantly increased cover of herbs on next-to-burrow mound plots as opposed to on burrow and control plots, while they decreased cover of graminoids, lichens, and litter, which were the highest on sites without marmot activities. Equitability increased gradually in direction from controls, next-to-burrow mound plots to burrow plots. Simultaneously, marmots increased N, Mg and K on next-to-burrow mound plots as opposed to on burrow and control plots. Biopedturbation by marmots contributes to creating the gradient of vegetation between marmot free meadows and disturbed habitats. Tatra marmots encourage settlement of moisture and light-demanding plants with larger requirements for soil depth on their burrow mounds. On next-to-burrow mound plots they support acidophilous vegetation with grazing- and trampling-resistant or grazing-tolerant species. A considerable higher content of P was present directly on the mounds compared to next-to-burrow mound plots. Marmot activities alter soil properties, reduce the dominance of common species and thereby enhance community diversity. Their effects, depending on the volume and nature of their activities, are the strongest on hibernation and maternal burrows and their surroundings. Our results demonstrate the key role of environment-marmot interactions in alpine ecosystems and landscape development.},

abstract = {Salvage logging after disturbances in forests substantially modifies vegetation structure and dead wood availability, but empirical evidence on its impact on biodiversity, especially in European boreal forest, is sparse. In this study we investigated the short-term effect of post-fire salvage logging on species richness and abundance of birds in recently burned mixed coniferous forest. Using point counts we estimated local species composition at 49 salvaged sites and 55 non-intervention sites (burnt forest left for natural regeneration) that were not logged after a fire in south-central Sweden. Local species richness, abundance and Simpson's species diversity index were significantly higher at non-intervention sites compared to salvaged sites. Forest birds that rely on structurally complex forest stands, such as tits (Parus major, Lophophanes cristatus, Poecile montanus), robin (Erithacus rubecula), mistle trush (Turdus viscivorus) and tree-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) were mainly associated with non-intervention sites, while species that are typically linked to farm- or shrublands, such as whinchat (Saxicola rubetra), white wagtail (Motacilla alba), red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) were more common at salvaged sites. These results are consistent with the idea that post-fire salvage logging has an immediate impact on the bird species composition and abundance in boreal forest. We conclude that although post-fire salvage logging may be beneficial for birds occurring in open landscapes, it has negative effects for forest bird species richness and abundance, at least over the short term. To protect typical forest communities with many forest specialists of high conservation concern, we recommend reducing the extent of post-disturbance salvaging in forests of high conservation value and updating the existing management policy to restore the amount of woody debris and facilitate long-term structural complexity and biodiversity in densely stocked conifer stands.},

abstract = {In 2010-2012, investigations on Ips typographus populations were carried out in Norway spruce stands recently affected by bark beetle outbreak in the Beskid {\.{Z}}ywiecki Mts. in Poland. The aim of the study was to test the usefulness of several traits describing I. typographus populations for evaluation of their actual outbreak tendency. Infestation density, sex ratio, gallery length, progeny number and beetle length were used as the traits. Trait variability was analyzed in relation to infested tree mortality in the current year of observation and outbreak tendency defined by the comparison of data on tree mortality in the current year and that in the year before.The highest infestation density was found in the stands representing the highest tree mortality in the current year and in those characterized by decreasing outbreak tendency. The gallery system with 2 maternal galleries dominated. The sex ratio of attacking beetles inclined towards females (63.8{\%}) and remained stable during 3 years of observations; the highest percentage of females was found in locations being in stabilization/latency outbreak phase. The length of maternal galleries was somewhat negatively affected by infestation density and positively correlated with the number of progeny in the gallery. The average beetle length was 4.800 mm (± 0.293), ranging between 3.718 and 5.817 mm and being the highest in the uppermost class of tree mortality recorded in the current year of observation. The shortest beetles were collected in the stands with increasing outbreak tendency, and slightly longer - in the stands with outbreak stable and decreasing tendencies.None of the traits tested can be selected as a direct indicator for prediction of outbreak tendency in I. typographus populations. Possible reasons of variability in the analyzed traits are discussed. The traits indicate that I. typographus in the study area represent very high reproductive potential, thus the risk of repeated outbreak is very high},

abstract = {In this work, we assessed the factors affecting wind and snow damage of individual trees in a small management unit in western Finland. This was done based on inventoried damage and observed wind speeds and snow loading in storms Pyry and Janika in 2001 and Mielikki in 2002 together with mechanistic model. First, we studied which factors explain the observed damage in individual trees. Secondly, we studied how well the mechanistic model (HWIND) could predict the wind speed needed to uproot individual trees at the margins of permanent upwind edges. We found that Pyry storm caused 70{\%} and Janika and Mielikki 18 and 12{\%} of observed damage. In Janika storm, all trees uprooted. In other storms, both uprooting and stem breakage occurred. Scots pine suffered the most damage. Recently thinned stands on the upwind edges of open areas suffered the most damage. But, damage occurred also on soils with relatively shallow anchorage. HWIND predicted correctly damage for 69{\%} of all uprooted trees. No-uprooting was correctly predicted for 45 and 19{\%} of standing trees (all Scots pines), which were measured within and at the immediate upwind edge of same stands. HWIND model needs further validation at the permanent edges and/or on soils with shallow rooting to improve its prediction accuracy in such conditions.},

abstract = {Forest landscape management is based on the premise that resource flows as well as biodiversity levels and ecosystem processes are determined by the array and spatial arrangement of forest conditions, i.e., spatial structure, and its change over time. This paper points out that a quantitative basis for measuring spatial structure is a prerequisite to implementing forest landscape management. Without such, structural objectives cannot be established nor can the understanding of spatial dynamics necessary to achieve structural objectives be mastered. This paper presents a comprehensive collection of measurements, some old and some new, organized in a hierarchical framework. The framework organizes structural measurements by geographical scale, i.e., landscape and patch, and within these by areal, lineal, and topological categories. The hierarchical framework is offered as a means to simplify interpretation of a rather large and complex set of measurements. Using this framework, the paper presents more than two dozen measurements. In each case, the measurements are discussed in terms of calculation algorithm, interpretation, and timber and (or) wildlife habitat context. The potential use of the measurements for quantifying landscape structure is demonstrated with an example. The paper concludes with a general discussion of the implications of the measurements presented for forest landscape management.},

Themodels are obtained by recursively partitioning the data space and fitting a simple prediction model within each partition. As a result, the partitioning can be represented graphically as a decision tree. Clas- sification trees are designed for dependent variables that take a finite number of unordered values, with prediction error measured in terms of misclassifica- tion cost. Regression trees are for dependent variables that take continuous or ordered discrete values, with prediction error typically measured by the squared difference between the observed and predicted values.

abstract = {Harvesting branches, stumps and unmercantable tops, in addition to stem wood, decreases the carbon input to the soil and consequently reduces the forest carbon stock. We examine the changes in the forest carbon cycle that would compensate for this carbon loss over a rotation period and lead to carbon neutral forest residue bioenergy systems. In addition, we analyse the potential climate impact of these carbon neutral systems. In a boreal forest, the carbon loss was compensated for with a 10{\%} increase in tree growth or a postponing of final felling for 20 years from 90 to 110 years in one forest rotation period. However, these changes in carbon sequestration did not prevent soil carbon loss. To recover soil carbon stock, a 38{\%} increase in tree growth or a 21{\%} decrease in the decomposition rate of the remaining organic matter was needed. All the forest residue bioenergy scenarios studied had a warming impact on climate for at least 62 years. Nevertheless, the increases in the carbon sequestration from forest growth or reduction in the decomposition rate of the remaining organic matter resulted in a 50{\%} smaller warming impact of forest bioenergy use or even a cooling climate impact in the long term. The study shows that carbon neutral forest residue bioenergy systems have warming climate impacts. Minimization of the forest carbon loss improves the climate impact of forest bioenergy. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. Aim: Primary forests have high conservation value but are rare in Europe due to historic land use. Yet many primary forest patches remain unmapped, and it is unclear to what extent they are effectively protected. Our aim was to (1) compile the most comprehensive European-scale map of currently known primary forests, (2) analyse the spatial determinants characterizing their location and (3) locate areas where so far unmapped primary forests likely occur. Location: Europe. Methods: We aggregated data from a literature review, online questionnaires and 32 datasets of primary forests. We used boosted regression trees to explore which biophysical, socio-economic and forest-related variables explain the current distribution of primary forests. Finally, we predicted and mapped the relative likelihood of primary forest occurrence at a 1-km resolution across Europe. Results: Data on primary forests were frequently incomplete or inconsistent among countries. Known primary forests covered 1.4 Mha in 32 countries (0.7{\%} of Europe's forest area). Most of these forests were protected (89{\%}), but only 46{\%} of them strictly. Primary forests mostly occurred in mountain and boreal areas and were unevenly distributed across countries, biogeographical regions and forest types. Unmapped primary forests likely occur in the least accessible and populated areas, where forests cover a greater share of land, but wood demand historically has been low. Main conclusions: Despite their outstanding conservation value, primary forests are rare and their current distribution is the result of centuries of land use and forest management. The conservation outlook for primary forests is uncertain as many are not strictly protected and most are small and fragmented, making them prone to extinction debt and human disturbance. Predicting where unmapped primary forests likely occur could guide conservation efforts, especially in Eastern Europe where large areas of primary forest still exist but are being lost at an alarming pace.},

Natural disturbances are among the most important factors that shape forest dynamics and forest landscapes. However, the natural disturbance regime of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests in Europe is not well understood. We studied the disturbance regimes in three forest reserves in Bulgaria (Parangalitsa, Bistrishko branishte, and Beglika), which are representative of the range of conditions typical for P. abies ecosystems in central and southern Europe. Our data indicated that large-scale disturbances were most numerous in forests that were between 120 and 160 years old, those with unimodal diameter at breast height (DBH) distributions, and especially those located in vulnerable topographic settings. Wind disturbances ranged up to 60 ha, followed in one case by a 200 ha Ips typographus (Linnaeus, 1758) outbreak. Older forests and those with more complex structures (i.e., reverse-J DBH) were characterized by numerous small gaps but were also affected by a few larger disturbances. In some old-growth forests at highly productive sites, gaps could be so numerous that the long-term existence of old trees may become an exception. Over the past centuries, the natural range of variability of these Norway spruce forests in Bulgaria appears to have been shaped mostly by wind and bark beetle disturbances of various sizes.},

Especially the blowdown in the biosphere reserve Bistrishko braniste (60 ha) raised much social debate because it was followed by a bark beetle (Ips typhographus L.) outbreak which caused the death of the mature trees on a territory of almost 200 ha. Yet little scientific research was done to study these natural disturbances. In our study we investigated the development of the I. typhographus outbreak with the use of SPOT 4 {\&} 5 satellite images from 2004 and 2008. We found that more than 60 {\%} of the affected areas were within 100 m and more than 90{\%} were within 250 m from the initial windthrow area or older bark beetle spots. Several attack spots at bigger distances (up to 2000 m) were detected. In the period 2005-2008 the outbreak area was twice bigger than the one at the period 2001-2004. Initially the Ips typhographus outbreak affected mostly forests with age of the majority of the trees of more than 100 years, but in the 2005-2008 period also younger trees were attacked. We hypothesize that the extent of the disturbance was largely due to the fact that most of the reserve territory was occupied by homogeneous singlecohort forest, which probably resulted from human use up to about 150 yrs ago.},

The re-measurement of permanent forest inventories offers a unique opportunity to assess the occurrence and impact of forest disturbances. The present study aims at exploring the main forest damages in Norway based on the extensive data of several consecutive national forest inventories during the period 1995-2014. Five of the most common disturbance agents in Norway are selected for analysis: wind, snow, browsing, fungus and insect damage. The analyses focuses on the frequency and variation along time, the average damage at stand level and the spatial patterns of damage occurrence, resulting in a characterization of the damage produced by disturbances in Norway. The highest damage occurrences by disturbance agent are due to browsing, snow and wind. Snow presents a decreasing temporally trend in damage frequency in the studied period. By forest type, mature and intermediate birch forest are found to be more affected by snow damage, whereas mature spruce forest is by wind damage. The results from this study provide support to the hypothesis that damages by autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) on birch are more common in mature stands. No major attacks from bark beetle (Ips typographus) are found, probably related to the lack of major storm damages in the period. Forest types susceptibility to fungus has no apparent variation over time except in the last years, as increased occurrence is observed on mature spruce stands probably correlated with warmer than average periods. Browsing damage causes the most severe losses, as expected, in young stands, and is allocated mainly on the most productive forests. Although some of the disturbances present locally moderate effects, the results show no major disturbances threatening Norwegian forests in the studied period. Finally, the Norwegian national forest inventory demonstrates its reliability as a basis to understand the occurrence and effects of major natural disturbances.},

abstract = {A dramatic forest decline due to the bark beetle outbreak, which occurs in the Norway spruce stands in the Western Beskidy (southern Poland) since 2003, was started after severe physiological drought during winter time. An analysis describing some spatio-temporal characteristics of this process, with special regard to the patterns of bark beetle occurrence related to root fungal diseases, is presented. In 2003 the bark beetle occurrence level assessed as high and catastrophic was recorded on 40{\%} of the area, while in 2006 – on 59{\%}. The range of {\textless}I{\textgreater}Armillaria{\textless}/I{\textgreater} root disease and bark beetle outbreak increased towards higher altitudes, including the zone above 1,000 m a.s.l. The wind damage in 2004 and 2007, and high temperatures in the summer 2006, further stimulated the increase in bark beetle populations level. Some conclusions on possible development of the outbreak and recommendations concerning related needs in forest protection, are given.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: European forests have a long record of management. However, the diversity of the current forest management across nations, tree species and owners, is hardly understood. Often when trying to simulate future forest resources under alternative futures, simply the yield table style of harvesting is applied. It is now crucially important to come to grips with actual forest management, now that demand for wood is increasing and the EU Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Regulation has been adopted requiring 'continuation of current management practices' as a baseline to set the Forest Reference Level carbon sink. METHODS: Based on a large dataset of 714,000 re-measured trees in National Forest inventories from 13 regions, we are now able to analyse actual forest harvesting. CONCLUSIONS: From this large set of repeated tree measurements we can conclude that there is no such thing as yield table harvesting in Europe. We found general trends of increasing harvest probability with higher productivity of the region and the species, but with important deviations related to local conditions like site accessibility, state of the forest resource (like age), specific subsidies, importance of other forest services, and ownership of the forest. As a result, we find a huge diversity in harvest regimes. Over the time period covered in our inventories, the average harvest probability over all regions was 2.4{\%} yr-1 (in number of trees) and the mortality probability was 0.4{\%} yr-1. Our study provides underlying and most actual data that can serve as a basis for quantifying 'continuation of current forest management'. It can be used as a cornerstone for the base period as required for the Forest Reference Level for EU Member States.},

abstract = {Wood production is an important forest use, impacting a range of other ecosystem services. However, information on the spatial patterns in wood production is limited and often available only for larger administrative units. In this study, we developed high-resolution wood production maps for European forests. We collected wood production statistics for 29 European countries from 2000 to 2010, as well as comprehensive sets of biophysical and socioeconomic location factors. We used regression analyses to produce maps indicating the harvest likelihood on a 1×1km 2 grid. These likelihood maps were validated using national forest inventory plot data. We then disaggregated wood production statistics from larger administrative units to the grid level using the harvest likelihood as weights. We verified the resulting wood production maps by correlating predicted and observed wood production at the level of smaller administrative units not used for generating the wood production maps. We conclude that (i) productivity, tree species composition and terrain ruggedness are the most important location factors that determine the spatial patterns of wood production at the pan-European scale and that (ii) incorporating these location factors substantially improves the results of disaggregating wood production statistics compared to a disaggregation based on forest cover only. Our wood production maps give insight into forest ecosystem service provisioning and can be used to improve the assessment of potentials and costs of woody biomass supply.},

abstract = {The overall objective of this study was to combine national forest inventory data and remotely sensed data to produce pan-European maps on growing stock and above-ground woody biomass for the two species groups " broadleaves" and " conifers" An automatic up-scaling approach making use of satellite remote sensing data and field measurement data was applied for EU-wide mapping of growing stock and above-ground biomass in forests. The approach is based on sampling and allows the direct combination of data with different measurement units such as forest inventory plot data and satellite remote sensing data. For the classification, data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used. Comprehensive field measurement data from national forest inventories for 98,979 locations from 16 countries were used for which tree species and growing stock estimates were available. The classification results were evaluated by comparison with regional estimates derived independently from the classification from national forest inventories. The validation at the regional level shows a high correlation between the classification results and the field based estimates with correlation coefficient r=0.96 for coniferous, r=0.94 for broadleaved and r=0.97 for total growing stock per hectare. The mean absolute error of the estimations is 25m3/ha for coniferous, 20m3/ha for broadleaved and 25m3/ha for total growing stock per hectare. Biomass conversion and expansion factors were applied to convert the growing stock classification results to carbon stock in above-ground biomass. As results of the classification, coniferous and broadleaved growing stock as well as carbon stock of the above-ground biomass is mapped on a wall-to-wall basis with a spatial resolution of 500m×500m per grid cell. The mapped area is 5millionkm2, of which 2millionkm2 are forests, and covers the whole European Union, the EFTA countries, the Balkans, Belarus, the Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. Given the global intensification of forest management and climate change, protecting and studying forests that develop free of direct human intervention—also known as primary forests—are becoming increasingly important. Yet, most countries still lack data regarding primary forest distribution. Previous studies have tested remote sensing approaches as a promising tool for identifying primary forests. However, their precision is highly dependent on data quality and resolution, which vary considerably. This has led to underestimation of primary forest abundance and distribution in some regions, such as the temperate zone of Europe. Field-based inventories of primary forests and methodologies to conduct these assessments are inconsistent; incomplete or inaccurate mapping increases the vulnerability of primary forest systems to continued loss from clearing and land-use change. We developed a comprehensive methodological approach for identifying primary forests, and tested it within one of Europe's hotspots of primary forest abundance: the Carpathian Mountains. From 2009 to 2015, we conducted the first national-scale primary forest census covering the entire 49,036 km2 area of the Slovak Republic. We analyzed primary forest distribution patterns and the representativeness of potential vegetation types within primary forest remnants. We further evaluated the conservation status and extent of primary forest loss. Remaining primary forests are small, fragmented, and often do not represent the potential natural vegetation. We identified 261 primary forest localities. However, they represent only 0.47{\%} of the total forested area, which is 0.21{\%} of the country's land area. The spatial pattern of primary forests was clustered. Primary forests have tended to escape anthropogenic disturbance on sites with higher elevations, steeper slopes, rugged terrain, and greater distances from roads and settlements. Primary forest stands of montane mixed and subalpine spruce forests are more abundant compared to broadleaved forests. Notably, several habitat types are completely missing within primary forests (e.g., floodplain forests). More than 30{\%} of the remaining primary forests are not strictly protected, and harvesting occurred at 32 primary forest localities within the study period. Almost all logging of primary forests was conducted inside of protected areas, underscoring the critical status of primary forest distribution in this part of Europe. Effective conservation strategies are urgently needed to stop the rapid loss and fragmentation of the remaining primary forests. Our approach based on precise, field-based surveys is widely applicable and transferrable to other fragmented forest landscapes.},

Results indicate better performance for principal component analysis and a multitemporal Kauth-Thomas transformation as compared to the Gramm-Schmidt orthogonalization process. There is little evidence to suggest that preprocessing beyond simple DN matching methods improves results. Relationships between change components and mortality are found to be specific to the particular image data being used and the particular forest type under study. Canopy change can be detected reliably, but precise estimates of mortality levels require calibration using field data in all new situations. Change in Kauth-Thomas wetness is the most reliable single indicator of forest change.},

abstract = {Powerful storms, consisting of strong gusts and winds, damage forests. Therefore, foresters need forest management strategies to reduce the damage risk. This paper focused on the damage patterns within the forest as the final results of multiple tree-wind dynamic interactions in time and space during a storm. Recent developments in computer technology allow for the possibility of simulating the complex and dynamic phenomena of damage during a storm but are extremely time consuming. To simplify the simulations without losing the crucial aspects of wind damage in forests, we introduced a computer simulation model using the agent-based modelling (ABM) technique, which capture the phenomena and interactions of individuals called ‘agents'. We created an ABM for forest wind damage simulation, coupling together an accepted understanding of wind gusts in forests, tree bending moments, and damage propagation. The model was tested with variations in three conditions: trees acclimated and unacclimated to their wind environment; three levels of gust strength; and three tree planting densities. The ABM was able to replicate damage patterns and demonstrate damage propagation within the forest and the effects of forest edges. The difference in the rate of damage in the forest between acclimated and unacclimated edges became similar with an increase in the gust intensity, and a decrease in tree density through a reduction in the shelter effect of the forest. The ABM could be improved in the future by parametrizing the variation in individual tree resistance, and the variation in gust and wind strength, as well as adding more information on local environmental conditions such as topography and soil variation, and storm characteristics such as duration and intensity.},

abstract = {Changes to global net primary production (NPP), vegetation biomass carbon (VegC), and soil organic carbon (SOC) estimated by six global vegetation models (GVM) obtained from an Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project study were examined. Simulation results were obtained using five global climate models (GCM) forced with four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. To clarify which component (emission scenarios, climate projections, or global vegetation models) contributes the most to uncertainties in projected global terrestrial C cycling by 2100, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and wavelet clustering were applied to 70 projected simulation sets. In the end of simulation period, the changes from the year of 2000 in all three variables considerably varied from net negative to positive values. ANOVA revealed that the main sources of uncertainty are different among variables and depend on the projection period. We determined that in the global VegC, and SOC projections, GVMs dominate uncertainties (60 and 90{\%}, respectively) rather than climate driving scenarios, i.e., RCPs and GCMs. These results suggested that we don't have still enough resolution among each RCP scenario to evaluate climate change impacts on ecosystem conditions in global terrestrial C cycling. In addition, we found that the contributions of each uncertainty source were spatio-temporally heterogeneous and differed among the GVM variables. The dominant uncertainty source for changes in NPP and VegC varies along the climatic gradient. The contribution of GVM to the uncertainty decreases as the climate division gets cooler (from ca. 80{\%} in the equatorial division to 40{\%} in the snow climatic division). To evaluate the effects of climate change on ecosystems with practical resolution in RCP scenarios, GVMs require further improvement to reduce the uncertainties in global C cycling as much as, if not more than, GCMs. Our study suggests that the improvement of GVMs is a priority for the reduction of total uncertainties in projected C cycling for climate impact assessments.},

abstract = {European forestry is facing many challenges, including the need to adapt to climate change and an unprecedented increase in forest damage. We investigated these challenges in a Norway spruce-dominated mountain region in Central Europe. We used the model Sibyla to explore forest biomass production to the year 2100 under climate change and under two alternative management systems: the currently applied management (CM), which strives to actively improve the forest's adaptive capacity, and no management (NM) as a reference. Because biodiversity is thought to have mostly positive effects on the adaptive capacity of forests and on the quality of ecosystem services, we explored how climate change and management affect indicators of biodiversity. We found a differential response across the elevation-climatic gradient, including a drought-induced decrease in biomass production over large areas. With CM, the support of non-spruce species and the projected improvement of their growth increased tree species diversity. The promotion of species with higher survival rates led to a decrease in forest damage relative to both the present conditions and NM. NM preserved the high density of over-matured spruce trees, which caused forest damage to increase. An abundance of dead wood and large standing trees, which can increase biodiversity, increased with NM. Our results suggest that commercial spruce forests, which are not actively adapted to climate change, tend to preserve their monospecific composition at a cost of increased forest damage.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In recent decades, Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) forests of the High Tatra Mountains have suffered unprecedented tree mortality caused by European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). Analysis of the spatiotemporal pattern of bark beetle outbreaks across the landscape in consecutive years can provide new insights into the population dynamics of tree-killing insects. A bark beetle outbreak occurred in the High Tatra Mountains after a storm damaged more than 10,000 ha of forests in 2004. We combined yearly Landsat-derived bark beetle infestation spots from 2006 to 2014 and meteorological data to identify the susceptibility of forest stands to beetle infestation. We found that digital elevation model (DEM)-derived potential radiation loads predicted beetle infestation, especially in the peak phase of beetle epidemic. Moreover, spots attacked at the beginning of our study period had higher values of received solar radiation than spots at the end of the study period, indicating that bark beetles prefer sites with higher insolation during outbreak. We conclude that solar radiation, easily determined from the DEM, better identified beetle infestations than commonly used meteorological variables. We recommend including potential solar radiation in beetle infestation prediction models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The onset of the phenological phases, such as budburst, leaf development, flowering, fruiting, and leaf senescence, is evoked by the genetically determined internal periodicity of vegetation and significantly affected by climate conditions. Therefore, the timing of the onset of phenological phases is considered as a good indicator of climate change impacts. The phenological phases of ecosystems can be observed from satellites using the change in spectral radiance that is mainly driven by leaf optical properties, leaf arrangement and total leaf area in canopy. In this study we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator of beech forests (Fagus sylvatica L.) seasonal dynamics in five test sites in Slovakia. During one growing season we analysed the phenological phases at each test site using three different approaches: i) in situ phenological observations, ii) digital hemispherical images taken to characterize the changes in the leaf area index (LAI) and in the plant area index (PAI), iii) NDVI calculated from space-borne MODIS sensor data. The estimates of LAI and PAI directly depend on the precision of canopy gap fraction (transmittance) estimates derived from the hemispherical images. Hence, we tested pixel classification based on the subjective decision of an operator and a recently proposed linear conversion of camera raw data (LinearRatio) which has been shown to produce comparable results to commonly used plant canopy analyzers. The results showed that NDVI values reacted sensitively to the changes of vegetative phenological phases. The most rapid increase of NDVI was recorded during the leaf unfolding phenophase. After reaching its maximum, the NDVI values in all test sites started to decrease slowly during the summer. This was followed by the rapid decrease during leaf senescence in the autumn. The main changes in NDVI were well explained by the changes in LAI; however, the impact of LAI estimation method was significant. The canopy transmittance calculated from subjectively classified hemispherical images started to increase already in May, whereas the LinearRatio-based gap fraction continued to decrease until the end of July, which was in concordance with the observation performed in situ. The LAI estimates using canopy gap fraction from LinearRatio procedure did not indicate the saturating relationship with NDVI at high LAI values (LAI {\textgreater} 3) as reported by many authors. According to our results, MODIS NDVI can be used to observe phenological phases in mature beech forests. For the calculation of transmittance, which is required to estimate leaf area index from hemispherical images, we recommend using LinearRatio based methods.},

We described and evaluated nine datasets providing such information: Corine LandCover, four European forest maps and four tree species distribution maps. Apart from providing a condensed overview of these datasets, we focused on the match between selected forest maps and forest management plans (FMPs) of Slovakia, which can be thought of as highly accurate information on forest distribution. The degree of match between forest and species area, within 306 forest administrative districts of Slovakia, was used as an indicator of accuracy. In addition, the match between the total forest and species area in Slovakia, given by FMPs and by evaluated datasets, was addressed. We found a high degree of match for the datasets on forest distribution (R-square 0.77{\&}ndash;0.93, depending on the dataset), as well as strong agreement in total forest area ({\&}plusmn; 5{\%}). Both indicators are worse in the case of forest type evaluation (coniferous and broadleaved). Poor results were obtained for tree species maps, which under- or overestimated species areas by tens of per cent, although differences were highly variable among species.

Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere.

abstract = {A data fusion method for land cover (LC) classification is proposed that combines remote sensing data at a fine and a coarse spatial resolution. It is a two-step approach, based on the assumption that some of the LC classes can be merged into a more generalized LC class. Step one creates a generalized LC map, using only the information available at the fine spatial resolution. In the second step, a new classifier refines the generalized LC classes to create distinct subclasses of its parent class, using the generalized LC map as a mask. This classifier uses all image information (bands) available at both fine and coarse spatial resolutions. We followed a simple data fusion technique by stacking the individual image bands into a multidimensional vector. The advantage of the proposed approach is that the spatial detail of the generalized LC classes is retained in the final LC map. The method has been designed for operational LC mapping over large areas. Within this paper, it is shown that the proposed data fusion approach increased the robustness of forest-type mapping within Europe. Robustness is particularly important when creating continental LC maps at fine spatial resolution. These maps become more popular now that remote sensing data at fine resolution are easier to access. ? 2011 IEEE.},

The methodology is based on scene-by-scene analysis and supervised classification. The fully automated processing chain consists of several phases, including image segmentation, clustering, adaptive spectral representativity analysis, training data extraction and nearest-neighbour classification. This method was used to produce a European forest/non-forest map through the processing of 415 Landsat ETM+ scenes. The resulting forest/non-forest map was validated with three independent data sets. The results show that the map's overall point-level agreement with our validation data generally exceeds 80{\%}, and approaches 90{\%} in central European conditions. Comparison with country-level forest area statistics shows that in most cases the difference between the forest proportion of the derived map and that computed from the published forest area statistics is below 5{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Deforestation and fragmentation of forests worldwide are negatively impacting biodiversity. The capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is an endangered umbrella species of montane forests in central Europe. Despite its status, it has largely been overlooked in forest management planning in the Carpathian Mountains, a biodiversity hotspot within the European Union. Previous investigations of timber management effects on capercaillie have shown contradictory results within Europe; habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive forest management have been implicated in population declines, while other studies have suggested neutral or positive effects. In Romania, recent changes in forest management have shifted from extensive, selective logging to intensive clearcutting; this change provides the opportunity to assess the effects of harvesting on capercaillie numbers across a full range of forest management intensities, thereby addressing discrepancies in the literature. Across the Southern and Eastern Carpathian mountains from 2009-2011, we used spring counts of capercaillie males at leks to evaluate the impact of forest management, other human activities, and habitat at two spatial scales - stand ({\~{}}2 ha) and landscape ({\~{}}300 ha). At the landscape level, the proportion of forest clearcuts and intensity of tourism had significant negative effects on the number of capercaillie males in the lek. In contrast, low intensity selective logging had a positive effect at the local stand (lek) level. Large scale (landscape level) forest clear-cutting had a negative effect on the capercaillie population - areas comprised of clearcuts of 30{\%} reduced male lek counts by 76{\%}. The protection of intact mature and old-growth forests, and forest management practices that emulate natural disturbance processes are recommended to support habitat of this critical umbrella species and associated biodiversity.},

abstract = {The capercaillie Tetrao urogallus is widely accepted as a species seriously suffering from fragmentation of forests and habitat loss. Foresters as well as conservationists agree on the need and principles for maintaining viable populations, but the proposed management means often differ. The approach currently favoured by Finnish foresters is to manage capercaillie leks and their surroundings using methods that differ from those used in intensive forestry. It may be desirable to prove that forests with capercaillie leks also favour other forest bird species and biodiversity in general. During the last 16 years (1987-2002), forest birds have been censused and capercaillie leks were mapped in the 465-km2 study area in southern Finland. Most of the study area consists of spruce-dominated mature forests. The remainder of the landscape is a mixture of variously aged forests, agricultural areas, lakes and scattered human settlements with a gradient from an agricultural-forest mosaic to forest-dominated areas. The old-growth forest bird species three-toed woodpecker Picoides tridactylus, pygmy owl Glaucidium passerinum and red-breasted flycatcher Ficedula parva were more abundant within 300 m and 1, 000 m radii around capercaillie lek sites than in non-lek control sites. Also the overall species richness of breeding forest birds was higher in the vicinity of capercaillie leks. On a larger scale (100 x 100 km squares), using the wildlife triangle scheme developed in Finland, we show that the density of capercaillie closely coincides with a wildlife richness index describing the total abundance of 15 other forest-dwelling mammal and bird species with diverse ecology and habitat requirements. Capercaillie is a flagship species for foresters, and can be considered a good candidate for an umbrella species for wildlife in taiga forests.},

abstract = {Abstract: Because of limited resources, biodiversity conservation practice is often reduced to measures directed at single species in the hope that this will simultaneously benefit other species in the same community. Such “umbrella species” should therefore have habitat requirements that are similar to those of the other species, whereas their spatial needs should be more extensive. The umbrella-species concept is often applied in management yet rarely tested beforehand. The Capercaillie (   Tetrao urogallus) is a large forest grouse that is declining over much of its range in Central Europe. It is considered a good example of an umbrella species and is now widely receiving attention from forestry managers. We tested its usefulness as an umbrella species in the Swiss Prealps by analyzing relationships between Capercaillie occurrence and avian biodiversity and asked whether both were associated with the same habitat-structure parameters. Study plots with Capercaillie did not hold significantly higher bird diversity than plots without the grouse. However, the species richness and abundance of birds that are more or less restricted to subalpine forests (mountain birds) and that at the same time are on the red list was considerably higher in Capercaillie plots than in those without Capercaillie. Both Capercaillie and mountain birds responded positively to forest structure characterized by intermediate openness, multistoried tree layer, presence of ecotonal conditions, and abundant cover of ericaceous shrubs. Capercaillie may therefore be a useful umbrella species, at least for that part of avian biodiversity of conservation interest.},

The resistance to uprooting is predicted using the estimate of the root-soil plate weight to derive a resistive moment, while the resistance to stem breakage relies on values for the modulus of rupture determined for different species of timber A tree is assumed to be uprooted if the total turning moment exceeds the support provided by the root-soil plate anchorage. Similarly, a tree is assumed to break if the breaking stress acting on the stem exceeds a critical value of the modulus of rupture. The model is in general quite sensitive to parameter changes, which partly results from the location in the forest to which it was designed to apply (the stand edge). The predictions of the critical turning moments needed to uproot and break trees nevertheless give a good agreement on average with the Finnish tree-pulling data for Scots pine, Norway spruce, and birch.},

Even then, significant changes are indicated only in the SW of the domain and across the central Baltic Sea where there is some evidence for relatively small magnitude increases in the 50 year return period wind speed (of up to 15{\%}). There are marked differences in results based on the two Regional Climate Models. Additionally, internal (inherent) vari- ability and initial conditions exert a strong impact on projected wind climates throughout the twenty-first cen- tury. Simulations of wind gusts by one of the RCMs (RCA3) indicate some evidence for increased magnitudes (of up to ?10{\%}) in the southwest of the domain and across the central Baltic Sea by the end of the current century. As in prior downscaling of ECHAM4, dynamical downscaling of ECHAM5 indicates a tendency towards increased energy density and thus wind power generation potential over the course of the C21st. However, caution should be used in interpreting this inference given the high degree of wind climate projection spread that derives from the spe- cific AOGCM and RCM used in the downscaling.},

abstract = {Many reports on the effects of conventional salvage logging-the removal of fallen and damaged trees after a catastrophic windthrow-on subsequent forest restoration have focused on short-term results occurring over less than 20 years; however, this time scale is inadequate, especially for boreal forests, because of the time required for tree growth. Here, we examine the long-term effects of salvage logging after a catastrophic windthrow event in 1954 on the resilience of a boreal forest by assessing the continuous recruitment of coniferous trees, dominance of typical coniferous tree species, and potential for future recruitment. We targeted two regions with different proportions of coniferous trees that were subject to three disturbance and management histories: windthrow (WT: fallen trees left intact), windthrow and salvage (WT+SL: salvage logged after the windthrow), and old growth (OG: not affected by the windthrow). In both regions, past salvaging has had serious negative impacts on the continuous recruitment of coniferous trees and potential for future recruitment. Negative impacts on the dominance of typical coniferous tree species were only observed in mixed forests. Our results suggest that in comparison to the coniferous forest, the mixed forest was less resilient, i.e.; the capability of a forest to maintain its identity as assessed by the dominance and recruitment of typical conifer species after wind disturbance and salvage logging. We found that salvage logging could affect forest structure, even 60 years later, by destroying advanced growth, including potential mother trees, and nursery beds for seedlings of typical conifer tree species.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to study the potential impacts of strong winds, heavy snow loads, and soil frost con-ditions on the risks to forests in northern Europe under the current and changing climate (until 2100), with the main focus on Finland. More specifically, the analyses concentrated on: i) changes in the occurrence of strong winds, heavy snow loads, and unfrozen soil conditions in Finland, ii) regional risks to Finnish forests from heavy snow loads and strong winds, iii) the mean and extreme geostrophic wind speeds in Northern Europe, and iv) estimation of windstorm-related timber losses in Europe in 1960-2011 using the geostrophic and ageo-strophic isallobaric winds as a basis for the analyses. This work employed the meteorological measurements made by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) between 1961-2009, the datasets from the Finnish National Forest Inventory and the EFIATLANTIC storm catalogue, a number of global climate model (GCM) simulation runs using different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1) and re-analyzed weather datasets ERA-40 and ERA-Interim. The occur-rence and depths of soil frost were studied with a model that simulates the freezing of the snow-free ground. The occurrence of large snow loads was estimated with the cumulative snow load approach. The analyses of the risks from snow and/or wind to forests were based on simulations done by the ecosystem model SIMA, the mechanistic model HWIND, and a new regression fit between storm wind impact and timber losses in Europe.},

abstract = {Forest ecosystems provide a wide variety of ecosystem services to society. In harsh mountain environments, the regulating services of forests are of particular importance. Managing mountain forests for regulating services is a cost- and labor intensive endeavor. Yet, also unmanaged forests regulate the environment. In the context of evidence-based decision making it is thus important to scrutinize if current management recommendations improve the supply of regulating ecosystem services over unmanaged development trajectories. A further issue complicating decision making in the context of regulating ecosystem services is their high sensitivity to climate change. Climate-mediated increases in natural disturbances, for instance, could strongly reduce the supply of regulating services from forests in the future. Given the profound environmental changes expected for the coming decades it remains unclear whether forest management will still be able to significantly control the future trajectories of mountain forest development, or whether the management effect will be superseded by a much stronger climate and disturbance effect. Here, our objectives were (i)to quantify the future regulating service supply from a 6456 ha landscape in the Stubai valley in Tyrol, Austria, and (ii)to assess the relative importance of management, climate, and natural disturbances on the future supply of regulating ecosystem services. We focused our analysis on climate regulation, water regulation, and erosion regulation, and used the landscape simulation model iLand to quantify their development under different climate scenarios and management strategies. Our results show that unmanaged forests are efficient in providing regulating ecosystem services. Both climate regulation and erosion regulation were higher in unmanaged systems compared to managed systems, while water regulation was slightly enhanced by management. Overall, direct effects of climate change had a stronger influence on the future supply of regulating services than management and natural disturbances. The ability of management to control ecosystem service supply decreased sharply with the severity of future climate change. This finding highlights that forest management could be severely stymied in the future if climate change continues to proceed at its current rate. An improved quantitative understanding of the drivers of future ecosystem service supply is needed to more effectively combine targeted management efforts and natural ecosystem dynamics towards sustaining the benefits society derives from forests in a rapidly changing world.},

@article{Attiwill1994,
abstract = {The extensive literature on natural disturbance in forests is reviewed in terms of the hypotheses: (1) that disturbance is a major force moulding the development, structure and function of forests; and (b) that management of forests for all their benefits can be controlled so that the effects can be contained within those which result from natural disturbance. The causal factors of natural disturbance are both endogenous and exogenous; there are major difficulties in the formal characterization of disturbance and of recovery after disturbance. As to the latter, the acceptance of classical generalizations of the nature of succession has led to particular difficulties in the assessment and interpretation of recovery. Tree fall, which creates gaps, is fundamental to the development of many forests, and has been most intensively studied in tropical forests of Central America and the Amazon and in temperate forests of North America. Tree fall is part of autogenic change; mechanisms of gap-filling and subsequent growth and species composition vary widely with forest type and geography. Disturbance by wind is particularly difficult to characterize. Wind varies along a continuum; the blow-down of an individual tree may be mostly due to autogenic processes of ageing and decay, whereas catastrophic hurricanes and cyclones may be defined as wholly exogenous. Nevertheless, the resilience in terms of species diversity of tropical forests following catastrophic disturbance by hurricane is remarkable. A number of studies support the view that the tropical forest in hurricane-prone areas is not a stable steady-state ecosystem but rather that heterogeneity is maintained by catastrophe. The ability to regenerate by suckers and the coincidence of regenerative space and gregarious flowering are important components of the response of rainforest following disturbance. For much of the world, 'fire is the dominant fact of forest history'. As examples, fire and its effects are reviewed for the northern boreal forests, oak-pine forests and north-western sub-alpine forests of North America. The effect of fire on species composition varies with intensity and frequency. That, together with the popular view of fire as unnatural and therefore unacceptable, places great demands on management of forests for all of their benefits, including national parks and reserves. These difficulties also affect management of other ecosystems, such as Mediterranean-type shrublands and heathlands where species diversity, productivity and cycles of regeneration and degradation are governed by fire as a natural disturbance. Shifting agriculture is a traditional form of agriculture used by at least 240 million people in the humid tropics. Shifting agriculture, together with wind, lightning and fire, is an exogenous disturbance which has little effect on soil fertility and on structure and composition of the rainforest which re-establishes after abandonment. As the intensity of disturbance of rainforest increases, resilience of the forest decreases and the current problems of extensive clearing for improved pasture and of uncontrolled logging are resulting in degraded ecosystems. Regeneration follows the often extensive death of trees caused by outbreaks of insects in many coniferous forests of northern America. This disturbance by herbivory halts increasing stagnation (as measured by decreasing rates of ecosystem production and nutrient cycling) and reinitiates succession. Other disturbances to forests occur through damage from ice-storms, snow avalanches, erosional and earthquake landslides, and volcanic activity; the development of Nothofagus forests in Chile and New Zealand is determined by such catastrophic mass movements. An extensive literature supports the hypothesis that natural disturbance is fundamental to the development of structure and function of forest ecosystems. It follows that our management of natural forest should be based on an ecological understanding of the processes of natural disturbance. Whether or not we want to do this, and the extent to which we want to derive all of the benefits from the forest, including timber, depends on social attitudes. Whereas humanism may treat conservation as the wise husbanding of forests in the interests of social traditions and harmony, animism may give nature unalienable rights. The conclusion from this review is that the ecological framework of natural disturbance and the knowledge of its component processes and effects provides the basis on which we can manage our forests as a renewable resource which can be utilized so that the forests 'retain their diversity and richness for mankind's continuing benefit'. Nowhere is this management more desperately needed than for the protection of the world's tropical forests, its peoples and their cultures.},

abstract = {Reliable high spatial resolution information on the variation of extreme wind speeds under frozen and unfrozen soil conditions can enhance wind damage risk management in forestry. In this study, we aimed to produce spatially detailed estimates for the 10-year return level of maximum wind speeds for frozen ({\textgreater}20 cm frost depth) and unfrozen soil conditions for dense Norway spruce stands on clay or silt soil, Scots pine stands on sandy soil and Scots pine stands on drained peatland throughout Finland. For this purpose, the coarse resolution estimates of the 10-year return levels of maximum wind speeds based on 1979–2014 ERA-Interim reanalysis were downscaled to 20 m grid by using the wind multiplier approach, taking into account the effect of topography and surface roughness. The soil frost depth was estimated using a soil frost model. Results showed that due to a large variability in the timing of annual maximum wind speed, differences in the 10-year return levels of maximum wind speeds between the frozen and unfrozen soil seasons are generally rather small. Larger differences in this study are mostly found in peatlands, where soil frost seasons are notably shorter than in mineral soils. Also, the high resolution of wind multiplier downscaling and consideration of wind direction revealed some larger local scale differences around topographic features like hills and ridgelines.},

abstract = {1. The ongoing changes to climate challenge the conservation of forest biodiversity. Yet, in thermally limited systems, such as temperate forests, not all species groups might be affected negatively. Furthermore, simultaneous changes in the disturbance regime have the potential to mitigate climate-related impacts on forest species. Here, we (i) investigated the potential long-term effect of climate change on biodiversity in a mountain forest landscape, (ii) assessed the effects of different disturbance frequencies, severities and sizes and (iii) identified biodiversity hotspots at the landscape scale to facilitate conservation management. 2. We employed the model iLand to dynamically simulate the tree vegetation on 13 865 ha of the Kalkalpen National Park in Austria over 1000 years, and investigated 36 unique combinations of different disturbance and climate scenarios. We used simulated changes in tree cover and composition as well as projected temperature and precipitation to predict changes in the diversity of Araneae, Carabidae, ground vegetation, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Mol-lusca, saproxylic beetles, Symphyta and Syrphidae, using empirical response functions. 3. Our findings revealed widely varying responses of biodiversity indicators to climate change. Five indicators showed overall negative effects, with Carabidae, saproxylic beetles and tree species diversity projected to decrease by more than 33{\%}. Six indicators responded positively to climate change, with Hymenoptera, Mollusca and Syrphidae diversity projected to increase more than twofold. 4. Disturbances were generally beneficial for the studied indicators of biodiversity. Our results indicated that increasing disturbance frequency and severity have a positive effect on biodiversity, while increasing disturbance size has a moderately negative effect. Spatial hot-spots of biodiversity were currently found in low-to mid-elevation areas of the mountainous study landscape, but shifted to higher-elevation zones under changing climate conditions. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight that intensifying disturbance regimes may alleviate some of the impacts of climate change on forest biodiversity. However, the projected shift in biodiversity hotspots is a challenge for static conservation areas. In this regard, overlapping hotspots under current and expected future conditions highlight priority areas for robust conservation management.},

abstract = {Forest management has caused severe ecological degradation throughout the Globe. One of its most prominent consequences is the drastic change in dead wood profile and consequently in the dead wood dependent biota. Wood-inhabiting fungi are, considering ecosystem functions, the most important species group utilizing dead wood, because they take care of majority of the decaying process. The earlier research focusing on the effects of forest management on wood-inhabiting fungi has strongly focused on large dead wood pieces (i.e. coarse woody debris, CWD), even though it has been shown that a major part of fungal diversity utilizes (also) small dead wood pieces (i.e. [very] fine woody debris, [V]FWD). In this paper, we studied the effects of earlier forest management on the wood-inhabiting fungi occupying all dead wood diameter fractions including the smallest pieces. The study was conducted in boreal pine and spruce dominated forests in Finland. Altogether we surveyed corticioid and polyporoid fungi from 113,269 dead wood pieces in 8 previously managed and 8 natural forests. The composition of fungal community varied between the forest types (pine vs. spruce; managed vs. natural) and according to the diameter of the dead wood substrate. However, the fungal diversity occupying CWD, and some diameter fractions of FWD, was clearly lower in managed than natural spruce dominated forests. Moreover, most of the rare species were detected only in natural forests, especially spruce dominated, and based on the species accumulation curves these sites were also the ones where largest proportion of community remained undetected. The effects of earlier forest management are evident also in fungal communities occupying FWD. The effects are, however, clearly stronger in CWD and especially in spruce dominated forests. Consequently, the main focus in forest conservation and restoration efforts may still be targeted on increasing CWD volume in managed landscapes, but simultaneously attention must be targeted on retaining reasonable volume of FWD to ensure that the species specialized in utilizing it will not be driven to local extinctions. Combining this recommendation with increasing pressure for energy wood harvesting will remain as a challenge. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The long-term relationship between windstorms and forest disturbances in the Czech Lands is analysed in this paper, covering a very long period of 215 years (1801–2015). Based on documentary evidence and instrumental records, long-term series of severe windstorms in the summer half-year (April–September) and in the winter half-year (October–March) are compiled. Severe windstorms were more frequent in the 1820s–1840s, 1900s–1930s, and 1960s–2000s, less so in the latter half of the 19th century and in the 1940s–1950s. Their long-term variability is revealed with three differently-created series of forest damage for the periods of 1801–1900, 1900–1980 and 1963–2015. Based on these comparisons, 14 windstorms that did outstanding damage to forests are selected: 12 occurred in the winter half-year and two in July. They are further investigated with respect to their meteorological character and the damage done. In this sample, the high-impact winter half-year windstorms are typically related to very distinct ({\textgreater}45 hPa) pressure gradients between low pressure systems over the North/Norwegian Sea and high pressure systems south-west of the Iberian Peninsula, which exhibits an eastward-shifted and tilted NAO pattern, inducing the passage of frontal waves across the Czech Lands. High temperatures arising from south-westerly airflow and wet ground before windstorms provided conditions conducive to extensive windthrow in forests, sometimes with damage exacerbated by subsequent bark-beetle calamities. The increase in windstorms with outstanding forest damage after 1950 may be attributed in part to the negative consequences of forest management that prioritises high, short-term profits over ecological well-being.},

In a legislative proposal by the European Union, emissions from forests are accounted for in relation to an estimate of average emissions for a range of years in the past. However, different forest structures, management activities, growth variations and impacts of changing climate may result in considerably different future emissions. We assessed the magnitude of potential uncertainties due to changing climate and forest management to the projections of carbon stocked in above- and belowground forest biomass in Finland until 2050. We used an area-based matrix model, which was developed to incorporate climate-induced tree growth as a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. The potential amounts of both the carbon stored and extracted varied considerably depending on the level and allocation of future harvests. If realized, climate- or management-induced growth improvements could increase the carbon stocks by up to one third in the end of the simulated period. Projections based solely on business-as-usual transitions and harvests could therefore lead to inefficient decisions regarding future carbon stocks and harvesting possibilities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. The growing demand for wood to meet EU renewable energy targets has increasingly come under scrutiny for potentially increasing EU import dependence and inducing land use change abroad, with associated impacts on the climate and biodiversity. This article builds on research accounting for levels of primary timber consumption-e.g., toward forest footprints-and developing reference values for benchmarking sustainability-e.g., toward land use targets-in order to improve systemic monitoring of timber and forest use. Specifically, it looks at future trends to assess how current EU policy may impact forests at an EU and global scale. Future demand scenarios are based on projections derived and adapted from the literature to depict developments under different scenario assumptions. Results reveal that by 2030, EU consumption levels on a per capita basis are estimated to be increasingly disproportionate compared to the rest of the world. EU consumption scenarios based on meeting around a 40{\%} share of the EU renewable energy targets with timber would overshoot both the EU and global reference value range for sustainable supply capacities in 2030. Overall, findings support literature pointing to an increased risk of problem shifting relating to both how much and where timber needed for meeting renewable energy targets is sourced. It is argued that a sustainable level of timber consumption should be characterized by balance between supply (what the forest can provide on a sustainable basis) and demand (how much is used on a per capita basis, considering the concept of fair shares). To this end, future research should close data gaps, increase methodological robustness and address the socio-political legitimacy of the safe operating space concept towards targets in the future. A re-use of timber within the economy should be supported to increase supply options.},

abstract = {Human well-being highly depends on ecosystem services and this dependence is expected to increase in the future with increasing population and economic growth. Studies that investigate trade-offs between ecosystem services are urgently needed for informing policy-makers. We examine the trade-offs between a provisioning (revenues from timber selling) and regulating (carbon storage and sequestration) ecosystem services among seven alternative forest management regimes in a large boreal forest production landscape. First, we estimate the potential of the landscape to produce harvest revenues and store/sequester carbon across a 50-year time period. Then, we identify conflicts between harvest revenues and carbon storage and sequestration. Finally, we apply multiobjective optimization to find optimal combinations of forest management regimes that maximize harvest revenues and carbon storage/sequestration. Our results show that no management regime alone is able to either maximize harvest revenues or carbon services and that a combination of different regimes is needed. We also show that with a relatively little economic investment (5{\%} decrease in harvest revenues), a substantial increase in carbon services could be attained (9{\%} for carbon storage; 15-23{\%} for carbon sequestration). We conclude that it is possible to achieve win-win situations applying diversified forest management planning at a landscape level.},

abstract = {Forests' potential to mitigate carbon emissions to the atmosphere is heavily debated and a key question is if forests left unmanaged to store carbon in biomass and soil provide larger carbon emission reductions than forests kept under forest management for production of wood that can substitute fossil fuels and fossil fuel intensive materials. We defined a modelling framework for calculation of the carbon pools and fluxes along the forest energy and wood product supply chains over 200 years for three forest management alternatives (FMA): 1) a traditionally managed European beech forest, as a business-as-usual case, 2) an energy poplar plantation, and 3) a set-aside forest left unmanaged for long-term storage of carbon. We calculated the cumulative net carbon emissions (CCE) and carbon parity times (CPT) of the managed forests relative to the unmanaged forest. Energy poplar generally had the lowest CCE when using coal as the reference fossil fuel. With natural gas as the reference fossil fuel, the CCE of the business-as-usual and the energy poplar was nearly equal, with the unmanaged forest having the highest CCE after 40 years. CPTs ranged from 0 to 156 years, depending on the applied model assumptions. CCE and CPT were especially sensitive to the reference fossil fuel, material alternatives to wood, forest growth rates for the three FMAs, and energy conversion efficiencies. Assumptions about the long-term steady-state levels of carbon stored in the unmanaged forest had a limited effect on CCE after 200 years. Analyses also showed that CPT was not a robust measure for ranking of carbon mitigation benefits.},

abstract = {The review gives a short general history of the selection system, suggests a way to systematize silviculture and summarizes research on the selection system in Fennoscandia. The review is restricted to Norway spruce, Picea abies (L.) Karst, being the only tree species having documented examples of being managed with selection system in boreal Fennoscandia. It covers four main subjects: (i) the dynamics governing the stand structure and the possibilities to maintain a full-storied structure over time; (ii) how ingrowth is affected by stand density and structure, and by internal dynamics within the seedling-sapling layer, and to what extent it is possible to get sufficient ingrowth to perpetuate the selection system; (iii) the key characteristics governing volume growth at stand level; and (iv) the maximum long-term growth compared to the rotation-forestry system. The residual standing volume is crucial to the long-term growth level. A moderate harvest strength at relatively short intervals, focusing on the largest trees and leaving behind a large standing volume, results in a high sustainable volume growth, low requirement of ingrowth, large average stem volumes and low levels of damage to the remaining stand. Long-term volume growth can then be approximately equal to the site productivity expressed by site characteristics, which is lower than the level expected in even-aged plantations managed with rotation-forestry. The review ends with suggestions for future research.},

abstract = {Setting aside parcels of land is the main conservation strategy to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss worldwide. Because funding for biological conservation is limited, it is important to distinguish the most efficient ways to use it. Here, we assess implications of alternative measures to conserve biodiversity in managed boreal forest landscapes. We calculated four alternative spatio-temporal scenarios and compared these to the current management regime over 100-year time period. In the alternative scenarios, a fixed amount of funding was invested in (1) permanent large reserves (each tens of ha in size), (2) permanent small reserves (each a few ha in size), (3) temporary small reserves (based on 10-year contracts with private land owners), and (4) green-tree retention (small groups of trees retained on clear-cuts). To assess biodiversity implications, we used habitat suit-ability indices to calculate overall habitat availability for five groups of red-listed and habitat-specific species associated with decaying spruce logs. The possibilities for timber harvests did not differ among the scenarios, but biodiversity performance was different. The scenarios with permanent reserves tended to outperform other scenarios , suggesting that conservation policies based on permanent reserves are the most cost-efficient in the long term. Results, however, varied among time scales and species groups. In the short term, a strategy of investment in temporary small reserves was the most efficient. Habitat for species associated with old spruce dead-wood and preferring shade was rare throughout all simulations, and therefore, it is likely that these species cannot be sustained in managed forests. Species that live on fresh dead-wood and are associated with forest edges coped well in all scenarios suggesting that such species will persist in managed landscapes without additional conservation Communicated by M. Moog. efforts. Explicit definition of conservation objectives and time frames for conservation action are thus prerequisites for successful conservation planning.},

abstract = {Abstract. The bioeconomy has an increasing role to play in climate change mitigation and the sustainable development of national economies. In Finland, a forested country, over 50{\%} of the current bioeconomy relies on the sustainable management and utilization of forest resources. Wind storms are a major risk that forests are exposed to and high-spatial-resolution analysis of the most vulnerable locations can produce risk assessment of forest management planning. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of the wind multiplier approach for downscaling of maximum wind speed, using 20m spatial resolution CORINE land-use dataset and high-resolution digital elevation data. A coarse spatial resolution estimate of the 10-year return level of maximum wind speed was obtained from the ERA-Interim reanalyzed data. Using a geospatial re-mapping technique the data were downscaled to 26 meteorological station locations to represent very diverse environments. Applying a comparison, we find that the downscaled 10-year return levels represent 66{\%} of the observed variation among the stations examined. In addition, the spatial variation in wind-multiplier-downscaled 10-year return level wind was compared with the WAsP model-simulated wind. The heterogeneous test area was situated in northern Finland, and it was found that the major features of the spatial variation were similar, but in some locations, there were relatively large differences. The results indicate that the wind multiplier method offers a pragmatic and computationally feasible tool for identifying at a high spatial resolution those locations with the highest forest wind damage risks. It can also be used to provide the necessary wind climate information for wind damage risk model calculations, thus making it possible to estimate the probability of predicted threshold wind speeds for wind damage and consequently the probability (and amount) of wind damage for certain forest stand configurations.},

We employed simulations by forest ecosystem (SIMA) and mechanistic wind damage (HWIND) models in upland boreal forests throughout Finland to study regional risks of wind damage under changing management preferences and climates (current and RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios) over 2010–2099. We used a critical wind speed for the uprooting of trees as a measure of vulnerability, which together with the probability of such wind speed defined a level of risk. Based on that, we also predicted the stem volume of growing stock at risk and the amount of damage. In this work, medium fertility sites were planted to one of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), or silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) or to the tree species that was dominant before the final clear-felling. The vulnerability to wind damage, the volume of growing stock at risk, and the amount of damage all increased, increasing the most in the south when the proportion of Norway spruce (with shallow rooting) of the growing stock increased. Under a severe climate warming, the proportion of Norway spruce decreased the most in the south, opposite to that of birch. This decreased the risk of damage in autumn (when birch is leafless), unlike in summer. The low risk of damage in the north was due to the large proportion of Scots pine.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of dead wood amount and trees with nesting holes on species communities of birds, saproxylic beetles and wood-inhabiting fungi in beech forests. Data have been gathered in a standardized way in beech stands of three categories with different forest-use intensities in Southern Germany. While stands of the first category are subject to intense silviculture of high-quality beech, dead wood structures and trees with nesting cavities have been protected in the second commercial forest category for 30 years. There has been no wood withdrawal in the third category for 25 years. Therefore, dead wood structures and age of these stands are comparable to pristine forests. The main differences show up in dead wood amounts and in trees with nesting cavities. No differences were found in the total number of species and individuals. This is in stark contrast to species groups which indicate environments close to pristine conditions, such as wood-inhabiting birds and cavity breeding birds, as well as saproxylic beetles and wood-inhabiting fungi decline significantly with increasing thinning activity intensity. From our results we conclude that in deciduous forest logging, even if done selectively, will reduce the numbers of species with higher demand on structures typical for pristine or close to pristine forests. For a monitoring of forest influence in beech dominated forests it is important to focus on these indicator groups and not on the total number of species to recognize degradation in forest species. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In the eastern boreal forest of Quebec (Canada) windthrow is a major natural disturbance, given the long fire cycle interval. Understanding windthrow is essential to ecosystem-based forest management. Dead wood, live trees, and pit-and-mound microtopography are major post-windthrow attributes with known ecological importance. So far, these structural post-windthrow attributes have not been described for this ecosystem. In addition, ecological consequences of salvage logging after windthrow remain unknown, with no specific salvage standard being applied to maintain such attributes and biological legacies. In this study, comparisons were made between salvaged and unsalvaged windthrow to identify which post-windthrow attributes were more greatly affected by harvest operations and to clarify management options. Downed coarse woody debris (downed CWD), snags, live trees, and pits and mounds were characterized. We showed that downed CWD and snags diminished after salvage operations, with a more uniform distribution among decay classes. Pit and mound density was reduced after salvage logging compared to unsalvaged windthrow, with pits being smaller in the salvaged plots. From an ecosystem management perspective, retention patches with dead wood and standing living trees should be kept in salvaged cut-blocks. To minimize salvage operation effects on microtopography, machinery trails should be reduced to a minimum. Also, a certain proportion of windthrow should be exempted from logging operations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In Europe temperate forests play a prominent role in timber production, nature protection, water conservation, erosion control and recreation. For centuries temperate forests in Europe have been affected by forest devastation and soil degradation. Applying great efforts to eliminate the severe wood shortage of those days, countermeasures were taken during the last 150 years by regenerating and tending highly productive forests. High growth rates and an increasing growing stock of these forests indicate that formerly stated goals have been successfully achieved. Coniferous species were often favoured because they were easy to establish and manage, and gave reason for high volume growth expectations. Today coniferous forests expand far beyond the limits of their natural ranges. These changes have been accompanied by a loss of biodiversity, a shift to nonsite adapted tree species and reduce the resistance against storms, snow, ice, droughts, insects and fungi. Some of these hazards were further intensified by the increasing average stand age, as well as in some areas by severe air pollution. Climatic fluctuations, especially changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme warm and dry climatic conditions and of heavy storms, had considerable impact on forest ecosystems. The changing demands of today require a widened scope of forest management. Society is asking for sustainable forestry emphasizing biodiversity and naturalistic forest management. It is of great economic and ecological relevance to know on which sites today's forests are most susceptible to climatic and other environmental changes and hazards. In those areas adjustments of management through a conversion the prevailing forests towards more site adapted mixed forests needs to be considered with priority. The high diversity in site conditions, ownership, economic and socio-cultural conditions require strategies adapted to the local and regional needs. Higher resistance of forests will increase economic and social benefits of forests and reduce the risks by maintaining sustainable forestry. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40{\%} of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

abstract = {* The loss of suitable habitats is one of the main causes behind the loss of species and communities. Habitat fragmentation, that is, the division of the remaining habitat into small and isolated fragments, often co-occurs with the process of habitat loss. The spatial division of habitats decreases connectivity among local populations and generally has a negative effect on population viability, but it can also have a positive effect for some species, for example, due to released competition pressure. * In both animals and plants, certain characteristics such as low dispersal ability and narrow ecological niche are known to be associated with fragmentation vulnerability, but in fungi, systematic analyses have so far been lacking. With their small and highly dispersive spores, fungi could be mainly resource-limited, not dispersal-limited. * In this study, we analysed spatial occurrence data on 119 species of wood-inhabiting fungi to identify the species characteristics that are associated with high extinction risk and fragmentation vulnerability in particular. We modelled resource use and connectivity dependence separately for each species using the presence–absence data on 98 318 dead trees in 496 sites located on a gradient in the duration and intensity of land use in eastern Fennoscandia. We then related species' responses to connectivity to their resource-use patterns, life-history characteristics and red-list status. * Our results show that red-listed species are highly specialized in their resource use and suffer from loss of connectivity at three spatial scales: along the large-scale gradient, at the landscape scale and at the scale of a forest stand. In contrast, many of the non-red-listed generalist species are actually more likely to occur (per resource unit) in fragmented managed forests than well-connected natural forests. * Synthesis. We show that the expected number of red-listed species per a fixed amount of similar resources (dead trees) can be even more than 10 times higher in well-connected than in fragmented surroundings, and thus, protecting high-quality areas that are well connected is conservationally more effective than protecting small fragments distributed across the landscape.},

abstract = {A conservative estimate for the total number of species dependent on dead-wood habitats is 4000-5000 within the area of Finland, which accounts for 20-25{\%} of all forestdwelling species. A large body of data concerning the average amounts of coarse woody debris (CWD) in both natural and managed forests has accumulated during the 1990s in Fennoscandia, including results from national forest inventories. The average volume of CWD in old-growth forests is generally 60-90 m3ha-1 in southern Fennoscandia, and declines to 20 m3ha-1 close to the timberline. Available data and modelling results indicate that the volume is even much higher following disturbance, and only slightly lower in mature natural forests. In managed forest landscapes the average volumes vary between 2 and 10 m3ha-1 depending on the region. This means that the average amount of CWD at the landscape level has probably been reduced by 90-98{\%}. General species-area relationships suggest that such a reduction in available habitat might lead to the disappearance of {\textgreater} 50{\%} of original saproxylic species in managed forests in the long term. Several recent studies have shown that the number of saproxylic species per stand depends on the amount of CWD, and also on the average size and decay stage of dead trunks. These relationships can be explained by either higher habitat diversity (more different niches) or larger population sizes of individual species (lower risk for local extinction) with increasing amount of CWD. A third important factor explaining local species richness of species living in ephemeral habitat patches, i.e. dead trees that decay away, is the spatiotemporal continuity of suitable host trees. Important theoretical and practical issues for conservation, management and research include, for instance, how well the remaining high-quality patches (e.g. old-growth fragments, key habitats) can secure the regional persistence of saproxylic species, and how much, what kind, and where CWD should be retained in the ordinary managed forests in order to maintain most of the species},

abstract = {One of the objectives of forest conservation is the set aside of unharvested areas. However, the fragmentation and lack of connectivity of protected areas make the integration of conservation measures in productive forests essential. Strategies to integrate conservation of saproxylic biodiversity in forest management have been developed, but often considering only specific aspects or remaining preliminary otherwise. As the impact of climate change and anthro-pogenic stresses increases, the development and the synthesis of this approach is crucial. We reviewed the key literature on forest management for biodiversity conservation, integrating forest science perspective to provide a practical management framework. Our goal is to present a management framework that could contribute to the effective preservation of forest insect biodiversity at the landscape scale, without high economic efforts, and addressing the conflicts that still jeopardize sustainable forest management. The results of our review support the creation of micro-reserves inside productive forests, to support large reserves in landscape conservation strategies. Micro-reserves increase the resilience of forest ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbances, through the development of a heterogeneous structure, maximizing microha-bitat availability. Modeling forest management and harvest on local natural disturbance would extend the benefits of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in productive forests. Variable retention harvest systems, applied at the landscape scale, are a feasible and adaptable strategy to preserve and increase biodiversity , safeguarding structural legacies such as senescent trees and deadwood inside the productive matrix. The operational shift, from the stand to the forest landscape, is fundamental to extend the benefits of conservation measures. The Forest Biodiversity Artery, composed by several micro-reserves or {\^{i}}lots de senescence, connected by corridors of habitat trees and deadwood, constitutes a network that would deliver old-growth forests attributes to the productive matrix. This planning instrument would support forest connectivi-ty, and socioeconomic constraints.},

abstract = {In Europe, intensive forest management has severely compromised the habitat of forest insects, especially saproxylic beetles, due to the removal of deadwood and veteran trees. The loss of insect diversity may disrupt ecosystem functioning and affect the provision of important ecosystem goods and services in the future. Here we propose a novel approach for the implementation of conservation policies, by optimally allocating forest reserves and deadwood islands under multiple sources of uncertainty and minimizing economic risk. We use the saproxylic beetle Lucanus cervus as umbrella species, requiring that deadwood islands were spaced within its dispersal capacity. We show that current management and conservation practices are increasingly inefficient under changing environmental conditions and that the consideration of uncertainty requires a major expansion of conservation areas. Moreover, our results indicate that a strong diversification of management regimes, with a focus on selection forest systems, is required to reduce economic risk of forest management. We conclude that the integration of uncertainty into conservation planning may reduce the trade-off between production and conservation objectives in forest landscapes and is key to increase the efficiency of forest management in the future. Forest biodiversity has been declining worldwide at alarming rates and the implementation of conservation policies targeting at mitigating this trend is crucial 1. Biodiversity plays a central role in ecosystem functioning, affecting the efficiency of energy use and biomass production in forest ecosystems 2. Consequently, biodiversity loss poses a major threat to human well-being, as it affects the provisioning of ecosystem goods and services, such as wood production, climate regulation, erosion control and the regulation of water quantity and quality 3. Moreover, in the face of climate change impacts and the expected increase in forest disturbance activity 4 , maintaining biodiversity becomes decisive for the recovery of ecosystem functioning after natural hazards. Evidence shows that biodiversity may increase the resistance of ecosystem to climate extremes 5 , supporting key processes, such as pollination and nutrient cycling 6. Hence, biodiversity decline may trigger substantial economic and ecological losses in the future and the correct valuation and implementation of efficient conservation policies is urgent. In Europe, 85{\%} of forests are managed and used for wood production 7. This high degree of utilization affects the habitat of several taxa and requires optimized conservation solutions that promote the multifunctionality inherent to these ecosystems. Currently, insect decline is one of the most pressing issues to be addressed by conservation policies, especially due to the potential severe economic impacts through the loss of pollinators 8,9 .For example, Hallmann et al. 10 reported a shocking 76{\%} seasonal decline in flying insect biomass in Germany over the last 27 years. Saproxylic beetles represent a large share of forest biodiversity in temperate Europe and recent estimates indicate the existence of over three thousand saproxylic beetle species 11. These insects depend on dead or decaying wood in at least one phase of their life cycle and directly contribute to nutrient cycling and pollination 12. Despite the crucial role for ecosystem functioning, intensive forest management has severely compromised their habitat through the removal of deadwood and undersupply of veteran trees 13. According to the IUCN Red List, in Europe and nearly 18{\%} of saproxylic beetles are presently classified as threatened. The most recent assessment points out that 0.7{\%} of the species are critically endangered, 7.4{\%} endangered 5.4{\%} vulnerable and further 13{\%} of the species are near threatened 11 .},

Over the last two decades, the topic of forest ecosystem services has attracted the attention of researchers, land managers, and policy makers around the globe. The services rendered by forest ecosystems range from intrinsic to anthropocentric benefits that are typically grouped as provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. The research efforts, assessments, and attempts to manage forest ecosystems for their sustained services are now widely published in scientific literature. This volume focuses on broad-scale aspects of forest ecosystem services, beyond individual stands to large landscapes. In doing so, it illustrates the conceptual and practical opportunities as well as challenges involved with planning for forest ecosystem services across landscapes, regions, and nations. The goal here is to broaden the scope of land use planning through the adoption of a landscape-scale approach. Even though this approach is complex and involves multiple ecological, social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions, the landscape perspective appears to offer the best opportunity for a sustained provision of forest ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Background: Forest fires, insect outbreaks, and windstorms are common forest disturbances that are expected to increase in importance in coming decades. Post-disturbance management often involves salvage logging, i.e. the felling and removal of the affected trees. However, harvesting these biological legacies may represent a second disturbance whose effects on ecosystem processes add on those of the initial disturbance. Many of the potentially affected processes, such as soil erosion and stream water quality, represent regulating and supporting ecosystem services important for human society. In the last 15 years, much empirical evidence has been gathered on the ecological consequences of this management practice, and it has now become necessary to synthesise this evidence in meaningful ways for managers and decision-makers. Methods: With this systematic review we aim to synthesise the literature on the effects of salvage logging on ecosystem services and determine the effects of major effect modifiers such as disturbance type and intensity, the timing and method of logging, and the type of forest. We will conduct searches of the primary scientific literature, which will be selected and categorised according to its relevance to the topic and its quality. Each relevant article will be read in full to obtain the necessary data for meta-analysis and to identify its main conclusions. Mixed-effects models will be performed to assess the effects of the identified effect modifiers on the effect sizes of the salvage intervention on ecosystem services and to account for random effects arising from studies being performed in the same area. Sensitivity analyses will test the potential effects of study quality, and publication bias will be assessed with the trim and fill method. We will present the results as a narrative review and a meta-analysis.},

abstract = {This paper reviews an ongoing, large-scale multidisciplinary experiment designed to study the possibilities of rehabilitating forest structure and species composition through logging, dead wood creation and fire in managed Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in southern Finland. These forests have been utilized for several centuries with intensive management and clear-cut harvesting, which has been the dominant practice in Finland since World War II. During this era, the forest structure has become relatively even-aged, and the amount of dead wood has been reduced considerably. Simultaneously, due to an effective fire suppression policy, the role of fire in Finnish nature has been almost completely eliminated. One of the key species in biodiversity, aspen (Populus tremula), has also been actively removed from the forests in the past. Forest restoration activities, such as the creation of dead wood and the reintroduction of fire to forest management, have been suggested in conservation and restoration programmes. So far we have studied the immediate effects of restorative actions on forest structure, regeneration, soil nutrient status, understorey and epixylic vegetation, lichens and beetles. In the larger Evo research area we have also studied the population structure of aspen in both protected and managed forests. Our early results show that it is possible, through active forest restoration, i.e. the creation of dead wood and prescribed burning, to rehabilitate boreal forest diversity, even when a significant part of the wood volume is harvested for commercial use. Despite the fact that the immediate effects of fire on many species groups were negative, the long-term effects are expected to be predominantly positive. There is currently a decline in aspen populations in Finnish forests. The absence of large aspens in managed forests and the absence of younger trees/cohorts in conservation areas, combined with high mortality, is a significant threat to aspen-dwelling species. We conclude that studies on active restoration treatments, together with long-term inventories of several species groups, are necessary in order to assess the impacts of varying restoration practices for cost-efficient large-scale applications.},

abstract = {Keywords: critical wind speed / forest edges / mechanistic model / Monte Carlo simulation / risk of wind damage Abstract • The aim of this work was to analyze how the forest structure affects the risk of wind damage at the landscape level in a boreal forest. • This was done by employing: (i) Monte Carlo simulation technique for generating landscapes with different age class distributions, proportions of open areas (gaps), and tree species composition; and (ii) a mechanistic wind damage model, HWIND, for predicting the critical wind speeds at downwind stand edges of open areas (gaps) for risk consideration. The level of risk of wind damage observed at the landscape level was significantly affected by the presence of gaps and old stands. Even a slight increase in the proportion of gap areas or older stands had a significant impact on the total length of edges at risk. As a comparison, variation in species composition (Scots pine and/or Norway spruce) had much smaller impact on the risk of damage. • In conclusion, the effects of forest structure on the risk of wind damage should especially be considered by forest managers in day-today forest planning in order to reduce the risk of wind damage both at the stand and landscape level.

abstract = {The majority of untouched natural boreal forests have been regenerated through large catastrophes, occurring by intervals between 50 and 100 years. Storm and fire will open the landscape, result in a huge amount of dead or dying trees and let the pioneer tree species germinate. These processes are the guideline for Finnish forest management today. The main focus by maintaining the biodiversity in Finnish boreal forest zone is directed to managed forests. Nature-orientated silviculture on stand level is practised. The site type classification, a reflection of the modern concept of biodiversity and developed by Cajander early in 1900s, on the basis of natural vegetation composition of the site, has the central role by choosing tree species, regeneration methods and thinning procedure, and reflects also on the site productivity. The small size of stands, the abundance of natural seedlings in planted stands and the popularity of mixed stands have a positive impact on biodiversity of forests. The protection of small-sized valuable habitats in commercially managed stands, the leaving of retention trees standing and lying in the forest in all phases of the rotation, are activities made for biodiversity. Many insects and fungi are adapted to catastrophes and so they can survive in single stems left on regeneration areas. Maintaining the biodiversity in multifunctional forests is also supported by the new forest legislation and by the criteria of Finnish Forest Certification System. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Trade-offs and synergies in the supply of forest ecosystem services are common but the drivers of these relationships are poorly understood. To guide management that seeks to promote multiple services, we investigated the relationships between 12 stand-level forest attributes, including structure, composition, heterogeneity and plant diversity, plus 4 environmental factors, and proxies for 14 ecosystem services in 150 temperate forest plots. Our results show that forest attributes are the best predictors of most ecosystem services and are also good predictors of several synergies and trade-offs between services. Environmental factors also play an important role, mostly in combination with forest attributes. Our study suggests that managing forests to increase structural heterogeneity, maintain large trees, and canopy gaps would promote the supply of multiple ecosystem services. These results highlight the potential for forest management to encourage multifunctional forests and suggest that a coordinated landscape-scale strategy could help to mitigate trade-offs in human-dominated landscapes.},

abstract = {The circumboreal forest encompasses diverse landscape structures, dynamics and forest age distributions determined by their physical setting, and historical and current disturbance regimes. However, due to intensifying forest utilisation, and in certain areas due to increasing natural disturbances, boreal forest age-class structures have changed rapidly, so that the proportion of old forest has substantially declined, while that of young post-harvest and post-natural-disturbance forest proportions have increased. In the future, with a warming climate in certain boreal regions, this trend may further be enhanced due to an increase in natural disturbances and large-scale use of forest biomass to replace fossil-based fuels and products. The major drivers of change of forest age class distributions and structures include the use of clearcut short-rotation harvesting, more frequent and severe natural disturbances due to climate warming in certain regions. The decline in old forest area, and increase in managed young forest lacking natural post-disturbance structural legacies, represent a major transformation in the ecological conditions of the boreal forest beyond historical limits of variability. This may introduce a threat to biodiversity, ecosystem resilience and long-term adaptive capacity of the forest ecosystem. To safeguard boreal forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and to maintain the multiple services provided to societies by this forest biome, it is pivotal to maintain an adequate share and the ecological qualities of young post-disturbance stages, along with mature forest stages with old-growth characteristics. This requires management for natural post-disturbance legacy structures, and innovative use of diverse uneven-aged and continuous cover management approaches to maintain critical late-successional forest structures in landscapes.},

abstract = {Five years of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, attacks on lodge-pole pine, Pinus contorta Dougl., were analyzed in an early outbreak situation using generalized linear models to shed light on patterns in the colonization process. The chosen logit model indicated three covariates as significant factors in the probability of trees being colonized by the mountain pine beetle. The first covariate related to tree size and spatial relationships among trees colonized the same year; its effect was most obvious for trees in the smaller diameter classes. The other two covariates correlated with tree diameters and vigor, and they indicated a greater probability of attack for larger trees and trees with low vigor. The model showed that the probability of trees being colonized in this stand increased significantly as the outbreak gained momentum, but only as long as the food supply (trees with dbh ≥ 23 cm) was abundant. It also showed that the pattern of selection of large and small trees did not change significantly as beetle pressure increased over time. Findings suggested that big trees were important to outbreaks beyond simply generating beetles, and that many trees were colonized only because they were dose to other trees under attack.},

abstract = {Aims Mapping vegetation through remotely sensed images involves var-ious considerations, processes and techniques. Increasing avail-ability of remotely sensed images due to the rapid advancement of remote sensing technology expands the horizon of our choices of imagery sources. Various sources of imagery are known for their differences in spectral, spatial, radioactive and temporal character-istics and thus are suitable for different purposes of vegetation mapping. Generally, it needs to develop a vegetation classification at first for classifying and mapping vegetation cover from remote sensed images either at a community level or species level. Then, correlations of the vegetation types (communities or species) within this classification system with discernible spectral charac-teristics of remote sensed imagery have to be identified. These spectral classes of the imagery are finally translated into the veg-etation types in the image interpretation process, which is also called image processing. This paper presents an overview of how to use remote sensing imagery to classify and map vegetation cover. Methods Specifically, this paper focuses on the comparisons of popular remote sensing sensors, commonly adopted image processing methods and prevailing classification accuracy assessments. Important findings The basic concepts, available imagery sources and classification tech-niques of remote sensing imagery related to vegetation mapping were introduced, analyzed and compared. The advantages and limitations of using remote sensing imagery for vegetation cover mapping were provided to iterate the importance of thorough understanding of the re-lated concepts and careful design of the technical procedures, which can be utilized to study vegetation cover from remote sensed images.},

abstract = {This study examines the feasibility of using MODIS images (MOD02 products) for the detection and monitoring of forest clear cuts in the boreal forest in north-west Russia. The proposed approach combines three change detection methods, including Change Vector Analysis, Textural Analysis using the coefficient of variation, and Constrained Energy Minimization analysis. For each individual method a series of thresholds was tested in order to obtain an optimal identification of clear cuts. A clear cut detection was only accepted if the change was detected by each individual method. All input parameters needed were derived from a set of reference clear cuts, mapped from 30 m resolution Landsat ETM+ imagery and used also for accuracy assessment. Change assessment was tested with MODIS images of two and of three acquisition dates.

abstract = {Although drought affects directly tree physiology and growth, the impact of secondary factors (insect pests, pathogens and fire) is often greater than the impact of the original stress and can lead to important tree mortality. In 2003, Western and Central Europe experienced a drought and heat waves that led to extensive forest damage. This paper reports on the impacts of drought and high temperatures on forest insect populations in the context of this exceptional event. Observations of changes in population levels of the main European forest insect pests during and after the drought are presented and discussed in the light of current knowledge and theories of interactions between drought and insects. We investigated the direct effects of drought on life history traits and indirect effects through physiological changes experienced by host trees. Forest pest insects were separated in 4 feeding guilds: woodborers, leaf-chewers, leaf-miners and leaf-suckers. The impact of water stress varied according to feeding guilds.Woodborerswere positively influenced by prolonged water stress and the decline of host resistance. In contrast, defoliators profited better from the increased nitrogen in plant tissues linked to moderate or intermittent water stress. Field observations showed the importance of the soil water status in tree resistance against pest attacks. Thus, the 2003 drought confirmed observations from earlier droughts that, is case of bad choice of tree species in some plantations, site matching becomes a prominent and primary cause of the development of pest outbreaks. This exceptional drought may give us some indication of the impacts of extreme climatic events. However, observations of the performance at the individual level were not sufficient for predicting long-term insect population dynamics, which depends on complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors.},

More than 20 offspring per female were produced at the lowest density (0.5 fem /100 cm2)but only 0.6 per female at the highest density (31 fem/100 cm2). The offspring from the lowest density were about 50{\%} heavier than those from the highest density and also the fat content ({\%}) increased with decreasing density. Females weighed less and contained less fat than males. Male offspring from lower densities produced larger amounts of the pheromone components cis-verbenol and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol than males from the higher densities. Offspring from the highest density produced about half as many progeny as those from the lowest densities, showing an effect of density acting over more than one generation.

abstract = {A conceptual model of Douglas-fir bark beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) dynamics and associated host tree mortality across multiple spatial and temporal scales was developed, then used to guide a study of the association between the occurrence of beetle-killed trees and factors that might render trees more susceptible to attack. Long- term records of beetle kill showed that beetle epidemicswere associated with windstorms and drought at statewide and local spatial scales. At the landscape scale, beetle kill was associated with (i) portions of the landscape that were potentially drier (southern aspects, lower elevations) and (ii) portions of the landscape that had more mature and old-growth conifer vegetation. The patches of beetle-killed trees were aggregated with respect to other patches at scales of approximately 1 and 4 km. At the scale of the individual tree, there was not a strong relationship between beetle kill and resistance to attack measured by tree growth rate prior to attack. Our results show that landscape-scale phenomena and temporal patterns were more strongly correlated with beetle-kill events than was recent growth history at the scale of individual trees. We suggest that the multi-scale approach we employed is useful for elucidating the relative roles of fine- versus coarse-scale constraints on ecological processes. Introduction From 1992–1993 the forests of theWestern Cascades in Oregon experienced the largest Douglas-fir bark beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) epidemic in over 35 years. Efforts to mitigate economic losses due to the beetle have often overlooked potential coarse- scale constraints on beetle population dynamics and failed to consider patterns of bark-beetle induced tree mortality within the larger context of landscape and ecosystem processes and tree decline concepts (Castello et al. 1995).The magnitude and frequency of bark-beetle outbreaks reflect the population dynamics of the insects as well as the susceptibility of the host plants to attack. Specifically, beetle population density and associated tree mortality at a given point in time reflect the previous beetle generation's numbers and the availability of suitable breeding habitat (i.e., weak- ened trees).We propose that tree resistance to},

abstract = {Natural disturbances such as windthrow and bark beetle Ips typographus L. outbreak often affect protected areas with non-intervention type of management located in close proximity to managed forest stands. This raises concerns about the migration of the beetle outbreak from non-intervention zones to adjacent managed forests. In this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of large-scale disturbances by intervention and non-intervention type of management in the Tatra mountains (Central Europe). We collected a time series of Landsat images from 2003 to 2014, and applied maximum likelihood classification to map the extent of forest, windthrow, clear-cuts, beetle outbreak and fire. Our classified maps achieved high overall accuracies: 0.93 ± 0.03 ⩽ OA ⩽ 0.96 ± 0.03. The extent of forest declined over the study period. We found higher rate of beetle induced tree mortality in non-intervention versus intervention zone. Within two growing seasons after the windthrow, beetle infestation occurred in close proximity to uncleared windthrow ({\textless}∼250 m), which suggest the positive effect of salvage logging (removal of windthrown trees) on lowering the risk of beetle outbreak. The two times higher sum of disturbances in intervention then in non-intervention zone indicated the limited impact of sanitation felling (removal of standing beetle infested trees) to reduce beetle population. However, sanitation felling highly contributed to the decline of the forest cover. Overall, our results document the dynamics of windthrow, bark beetle and clear-cuts by type of management, and limited impact of logging activities in reducing beetle outbreak in neighboring areas with intervention and non-intervention type of management.},

abstract = {Norway spruce forests (Picea abies Karst.) of the Carpathian High Tatra Mountains have been subject to unprecedented tree mortality caused by attacks of the Eurasian spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) in recent decades. The outbreaks were preceded and accompanied by wind throw events and periods of increased seasonal temperature. We obtained climatic data and data on tree mortality due to storm throw and bark beetles by using a combination of direct dead tree inventory and remote sensing techniques, and examined annual tree loss change over a 26-year period in a forest district of the Slovak High Tatra National Park. In particular, we found that the combination of the previous year's maximum daily temperature sum, tree mortality caused by wind, and bark beetle-caused tree mortality best explained the annual tree loss change in nonlinear regression models. The number of trees infested by bark beetles clearly increased with maximum air temperature sums ranging from 2850 to 3150 ° days, but declined below or above this thermal optimum. Annual tree mortality clearly increased subsequent to years associated with seasonal temperature sums allowing for the development of sister broods. Given consistently favourable future climatic conditions for development of I. typographus populations in the study area, a possible shift from the now predominantly uni-voltine to multi-voltine bark beetle populations might increase attack pressure also at high elevation sites.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. The relationship between windthrow disturbance and outbreaks of European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus L. in European Norway spruce forests has been the focus of recent studies. However, the nature in which the spatial characteristics of windthrow events influence bark beetle population dynamics is rarely examined. This represents a significant gap in the literature, as our understanding of how spatial windthrow patterns influence bark beetles can be useful for management efforts to help mitigate large-scale bark beetle disturbance. The objective of this study is to simulate how windthrow events facilitate bark beetle population state transitions from endemic and epidemic levels using a spatially explicit agent-based model. We examined how the spatial extent of windthrow events and the size of tree clusters impacted by windthrow influence this state transition. The results show that the beetle population transition slows with increasing spatial extent of a windthrow event and with larger clusters of windthrown trees, while scattered patterns of windthrown trees accelerate the timing of this transition. This study contributes to our understanding of the role of large-scale wind disturbance in European bark beetle outbreaks. Moreover, it provides a basis for further research to discover the impact of potential forest management applications aiming to mitigate the risk of bark beetle outbreaks.},

abstract = {Mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) have killed billions of trees in the United States and Canada in the last decades, thereby causing major alterations to forest ecosystems. Therefore, monitoring the extent and patterns of these major disturbance events are important for subsequent forest management. At 30-m spatial resolution, Landsat imagery affords the opportunity for quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of bark beetle outbreaks at plot to stand resolution. We developed a continuous measure of bark beetle-caused tree mortality using multi-temporal Landsat data (1996-2011) in the Rocky Mountains of northcentral Colorado. We report the year of detection of tree mortality, which is 1year after attack by beetles. Two approaches were used to predict percent red stage tree mortality within a 30-m grid cell, multiple linear regression models and generalized additive models (GAM) with a nonlinear spatial term. Both models explained {\textgreater}75{\%} of the variance using three Landsat spectral explanatory variables. We used the linear model to predict tree mortality across the entire study area and time series because of its simplicity, its capability for extrapolation beyond the training area, and similar performance compared with the GAM. From 1996 to 2011, cumulative tree mortality was 22{\%} of forested areas within the Landsat scene, equivalent to 228million mature lodgepole pine trees (range: 174-332million trees using the 95{\%} confidence interval of field-measured crown areas). Early in the outbreak, tree mortality was associated with expansion, whereas later in the outbreak, mortality was due to intensification (increase in mortality within areas already having beetle activity). We used three metrics (cumulative tree mortality, duration of tree mortality, and average rate of tree mortality) to investigate the temporal and spatial patterns of bark beetle-caused mortality using different grid cell resolutions within the Landsat scene. At the Landsat spatial resolution (900m2), we estimated that grid cells within the outbreak experienced means of 60{\%} mortality, a duration of 3-4years, and an average rate of mortality of 20{\%}/year. With coarser spatial resolution, cumulative tree morality and rate of tree mortality decreased whereas duration of tree mortality increased. Our results improve the understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of tree mortality caused by bark beetle outbreaks, and provide specific information for forest managers and scientists about a severe mountain pine beetle infestation in northcentral Colorado. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

All rights reserved.Automatic identification of forest patches disturbed by the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus L. is crucial to reveal the rules of following bark beetle outbreaks on the landscape scale. Landsat imagery provides free resources to outline past and present gradations of bark beetle out- breaks (BBOs). The objective of this study is to identify the most sensitive vegetation index through different method of vegetation index differencing to identify past and actual bark beetle outbreaks. Six Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, from 2005-2009 and 2011, were converted into selected vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to conifer tree health in a Norway spruce-dominated forest in the High Tatra Mountains. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Disturbance Index (DI) and Changed Disturbance Index (DI´) were calculated separately for every year, and the methodology of vegetation index differencing was applied to multiple two-year time periods (2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009 and 2010-2011), thus producing the Changed Vegetation Index ($\Delta$VI). A set of thresholds was established on $\Delta$VI to classify disturbed and undisturbed forest due to BBOs; the sensitivity of different VIs to identify BBO was equally evaluated. The highest accuracies of classifications were reached in 2007 and 2011 (kappa index of agreement {\textgreater}70{\%} and {\textgreater}40{\%}, respectively), which were characterised by an epidemic phase of a BBO. All selected VIs were highly sensitive to BBOs, except for NDVI. The stable threshold value for change detection is not widely applicable to detect past forest disturbances caused by bark beetles, however. Finally, for further research of the epidemic phases of BBOs, we recommend the utilisation of the vegetation indices VCI, MSI and NDMI to detect BBOs because of their simplicity and easy interpretability.},

abstract = {Wind is the major abiotic risk factor in Finnish forests. Therefore, tools that help managers to assess the risk of wind damage are required. This study developed simple regression models for predicting the critical wind speed needed to uproot Scots pine, Norway spruce and birch trees at the stand edges in Finnish conditions, using the characteristics of the retained forest both downwind and upwind stands as predictors. Using information on the prevailing wind conditions in the region, the critical wind speeds were converted into probabilities of wind damage, from which a mean risk index was calculated. The mean risk index was used as an objective variable in heuristic optimisation. The results of minimizing the mean risk index were compared to other objective variables such as minimal height differences between adjacent stands. The residuals of the regression models of critical wind speeds were small, especially in Scots pine and birch. Increasing tree height of the downwind stand or area of the upwind stand (gap size) decreased the critical wind speed regardless of tree species, whereas increases in the dbh/height ratio of the downwind stand increased the critical wind speed. The shelter effect of upwind stand height was stronger in Norway spruce than in other tree species, whereas the effect of tree height of the downwind stand was larger in Scots pine and birch. Minimization of the mean risk of wind damage within forest landscapes led to smooth and non-fragmented landscape structures in terms of tree height. Incorporating even-flow constraints into the planning model led to a slight increase in the mean risk of wind damage. Of the surrogate methods for risk assessment minimization of height differences between adjacent stands performed well but not equally well as minimization of the mean risk index. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {ContextDistribution and connectivity of suitable habitat for species of conservation concern is critical for effective conservation planning. Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), an umbrella species for biodiversity conservation, is increasingly threatened because of habitat loss and fragmentation.ObjectiveWe assessed the impact of drastic changes in forest management in the Carpathian Mountains, a major stronghold of capercaillie in Europe, on habitat distribution and connectivity.MethodsWe used field data surveys with a forest disturbance dataset for 1985–2010 to map habitat suitability, and we used graph theory to analyse habitat connectivity.ResultsClimate, topography, forest proportion and fragmentation, and the distance to roads and settlements best identified capercaillie presence. Suitable habitat area was 7510 km2 in 1985; by 2010, clear-cutting had reduced that area by 1110 km2. More suitable habitat was lost inside protected areas (571 km2) than outside (413 km2). Habitat loss of 15 {\%} reduced functional connectivity by 33 {\%} since 1985.ConclusionsForest management, particularly large-scale clear-cutting and salvage logging, have substantially diminished and fragmented suitable capercaillie habitat, regardless of the status of forest protection. Consequently, larger areas with suitable habitat are now isolated and many patches are too small to sustain viable populations. Given that protection of capercaillie habitat would benefit many other species, including old-growth specialists and large carnivores, conservation actions to halt the loss of capercaillie habitat is urgently needed. We recommend adopting policies to protect natural forests, limiting large-scale clear-cutting and salvage logging, implementing ecological forestry, and restricting road building to reduce forest fragmentation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Different abiotic and biotic disturbances are expected to become more common in the future due to a warming climate. Globally, post-disturbance salvage logging is becoming more predominant to recover economic value from timber in disturbed forests. This study collected comparative time-study data and analyzed the productivity of cutting for windfalls in clear cuttings and determined the cutting costs of windfalls. Furthermore, the logging (i.e., cutting and forwarding) costs of wind-damaged trees and those of undamaged standing Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees in clear cuts were calculated in Finland. The results revealed that the cutting productivity of windfalls was 19-33{\%} lower than that of undamaged stems. The cutting costs of windthrown stems with a volume of 0.3-1.5 m 3 were 35-64{\%} higher and the logging costs of windfalls were 10-30{\%} higher than those of undamaged standing stems. The study provided new understanding regarding the productivity and costs of salvage logging operations under Finnish conditions. Even if the logging of windfalls is expensive and laborious, salvage logging operations are important for forest stands and their health to minimize post-disaster damage outbreaks in coniferous forests, such as the damage caused by bark beetles-mainly Ips typographus L.},

abstract = {Many algorithms have been developed for the remote estimation of biophysical characteristics of vegetation, in terms of combinations of spectral bands, derivatives of reflectance spectra, neural networks, inversion of radiative transfer models, and several multi-spectral statistical approaches. However, the most widespread type of algorithm used is the mathematical combination of visible and near-infrared reflectance bands, in the form of spectral vegetation indices. Applications of such vegetation indices have ranged from leaves to the entire globe, but in many instances, their applicability is specific to species, vegetation types or local conditions. The general objective of this study is to evaluate different vegetation indices for the remote estimation of the green leaf area index (Green LAI) of two crop types (maize and soybean) with contrasting canopy architectures and leaf structures. Among the indices tested, the chlorophyll Indices (the CIGreen, the CIRed-edge and the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index, MTCI) exhibited strong and significant linear relationships with Green LAI, and thus were sensitive across the entire range of Green LAI evaluated (i.e., 0.0 to more than 6.0m2/m2). However, the CIRed-edge was the only index insensitive to crop type and produced the most accurate estimations of Green LAI in both crops (RMSE=0.577m2/m2). These results were obtained using data acquired with close range sensors (i.e., field spectroradiometers mounted 6m above the canopy) and an aircraft-mounted hyperspectral imaging spectroradiometer (AISA). As the CIRed-edge also exhibited low sensitivity to soil background effects, it constitutes a simple, yet robust tool for the remote and synoptic estimation of Green LAI. Algorithms based on this index may not require re-parameterization when applied to crops with different canopy architectures and leaf structures, but further studies are required for assessing its applicability in other vegetation types (e.g., forests, grasslands). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In almost no other field of computer science, the idea of using bio-inspired search paradigms has been so useful as in solving multiobjective optimization problems. The idea of using a population of search agents that collectively approximate the Pareto front resonates well with processes in natural evolution, immune systems, and swarm intelligence. Methods such as NSGA-II, SPEA2, SMS-EMOA, MOPSO, and MOEA/D became standard solvers when it comes to solving multiobjective optimization problems. This tutorial will review some of the most important fundamentals in multiobjective optimization and then introduce representative algorithms, illustrate their working principles, and discuss their application scope. In addition, the tutorial will discuss statistical performance assessment. Finally, it highlights recent important trends and closely related research fields. The tutorial is intended for readers, who want to acquire basic knowledge on the mathematical foundations of multiobjective optimization and state-of-the-art methods in evolutionary multiobjective optimization. The aim is to provide a starting point for researching in this active area, and it should also help the advanced reader to identify open research topics.},

abstract = {We presented a methodology for drawing continuous boundaries in the landscape differentiating between regions with different floristic composition. A region in Central Slovakia covering 2,445 km2 was investigated. Ecological indicator values for temperature (EIT) in 1,978 grassland polygons were analysed. Ordinary kriging was used to interpolate EIT across the study region. Lattice wombling was used to identify the most intensive gradients in EIT and to draw boundaries, while ANOVA was used for post-classification analysis. A strong pattern of spatial continuity was present in EIT assigned to species in grassland polygons allowing for drawing continuous boundaries in the landscape. The study region was divided into 15 districts using the proposed method. Post-classification analysis indicated that 17 out of 23 adjacent districts were found to differ significantly in term of mean value of source samples. The results implied the need for incorporating spatial autocorrelation in sample data into post-classification analysis; such factor is often neglected in ecological research. The presented findings suggested broader applicability of the proposed method for spatial modelling, as vegetation data is widely accessible in databases for many regions of Europe.},

abstract = {This report covers the first year of a five year study in the development of an applied remote sensing strategy for resource management of BC forests and forest health, involving airborne remote sensing for monitoring and control of mountain pine beetle infestations. This project addresses the most efficient and reliable remote sensing strategies for identifying and mapping, in a practical and cost effective manner, early infestation stages (current attack) of MPB and subsequent advanced stages including detection and mapping of “red attack” and monitoring infestation spread across time. Digitally converted multispectral aerial photography was found to perform best for early detection of current attack and mapping and monitoring red attack. Results indicate that a spreading current attack can be reliably detected between mid May and early June at our sites. For mapping red attack a scale of 1:16000 is recommended at this time. For early detection experiments the 1:8000 imagery was superior but the 1:16000 imagery would be operationally effective. Aerial photography (multispectral and digitally converted) is clearly the remote sensing imaging system that can most accurately and cost effectively addresses this critical MPB problem. Of equal importance is the capability of aerial photography being implemented in a timely fashion by both government and the private sector in a business environment using competitive tendering.},

abstract = {The focus of the study was to assess gradual changes occurring throughout a range of natural ecosystems using decadal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM. +) time series data. Time series data stacks were generated for four study areas: (1) a four scene area dominated by forest and rangeland ecosystems in the southwestern United States, (2) a sagebrush-dominated rangeland in Wyoming, (3) woodland adjacent to prairie in northwestern Nebraska, and (4) a forested area in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Through analyses of time series data, we found evidence of gradual systematic change in many of the natural vegetation communities in all four areas. Many of the conifer forests in the southwestern US are showing declines related to insects and drought, but very few are showing evidence of improving conditions or increased greenness. Sagebrush communities are showing decreases in greenness related to fire, mining, and probably drought, but very few of these communities are showing evidence of increased greenness or improving conditions. In Nebraska, forest communities are showing local expansion and increased canopy densification in the prairie-woodland interface, and in the White Mountains high elevation understory conifers are showing range increases towards lower elevations. The trends detected are not obvious through casual inspection of the Landsat images. Analyses of time series data using many scenes and covering multiple years are required in order to develop better impressions and representations of the changing ecosystem patterns and trends that are occurring. The approach described in this paper demonstrates that Landsat time series data can be used operationally for assessing gradual ecosystem change across large areas. Local knowledge and available ancillary data are required in order to fully understand the nature of these trends. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Wildfires, insect outbreaks, and windstorms are increasingly common forest disturbances. Post-disturbance management often involves salvage logging, i.e., the felling and removal of the affected trees; however, this practice may represent an additional disturbance with effects on ecosystem processes and services. We developed a systematic map to provide an overview of the primary studies on this topic and created a database with information on the characteristics of the retrieved publications, including information on stands, disturbance, intervention, measured outcomes, and study design. Of 4341 retrieved publications, 90 were retained in the systematic map. These publications represented 49 studies, predominantly from North America and Europe. Salvage logging after wildfire was addressed more frequently than after insect outbreaks or windstorms. Most studies addressed logging after a single disturbance event, and replication of salvaged stands rarely exceeded 10. The most frequent response variables were tree regeneration, ground cover, and deadwood characteristics. This document aims to help managers find the most relevant primary studies on the ecological effects of salvage logging. It also aims to identify and discuss clusters and gaps in the body of evidence, relevant for scientists who aim to synthesize previous work or identify questions for future studies.},

abstract = {While studies on deforestation of protected areas (PAs) have been conducted in many parts of the world, no comparative study has been done over an entire country in the tropics. Thus, we conducted a country-wide assessment of forest cover loss in all terrestrial protected areas of the Philippines, covering 198 PAs with a total area of 4.68 million ha. This study utilised Hansen's Landsat-derived global maps of forest cover change from 2000 to 2012, with tree canopy cover data for 2000 as the base year. Correlation and logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the significance and magnitude of the relationships between forest cover and 11 predictor variables. The assessment of forest loss reveals that the terrestrial protected areas are generally effective in reducing forest loss. Over the 12-year period, the average rate (2.59{\%}) of forest clearing in protected areas is marginally lower by 0.1{\%} than the entire country (2.69{\%}). Within the same duration, the average forest loss rate within the 2-km buffer zones of selected protected areas is 1.4 times of those inside PAs. However, there was a significant number of PAs with phenomenal forest cover loss in terms of extent (48,583 ha over 12 years) and rate (up to 21{\%}). We found that spatial predictor variables included in this study have weak or no relationships with forest cover, and hence they are not reliable inputs for predictive modelling. Comprehensive assessments of deforestation are needed at the micro-scale (e.g. single PA level) level and relatively shorter historical timeframe (e.g. less than a decade), to generate useful information for policy formulation, planning, and management.},

abstract = {The attribution of forest disturbances to disturbance agents is a critical challenge for remote sensing-based forest monitoring, promising important insights into drivers and impacts of forest disturbances. Previous studies have used spectral-temporal metrics derived from annual Landsat time series to identify disturbance agents. Here, we extend this approach to new predictors derived from intra-annual time series and test it at three sites in Central Europe, including managed and protected forests. The two newly tested predictors are: (1) intra-annual timing of disturbance events and (2) temporal proximity to windstorms based on prior knowledge. We estimated the intra-annual timing of disturbances using a breakpoint detection algorithm and all available Landsat observations between 1984 and 2016. Using spectral, temporal, and topography-related metrics, we then mapped four disturbance classes: windthrow, cleared windthrow, bark beetles, and other harvest. Disturbance agents were identified with overall accuracies of 76–86{\%}. Temporal proximity to storm events was among the most important predictors, while intra-annual timing itself was less important. Moreover, elevation information was very effective for discriminating disturbance agents. Our results demonstrate the potential of incorporating dense, intra-annual Landsat time series information and prior knowledge of disturbance events for monitoring forest ecosystem change at the disturbance agent level.},

abstract = {Context Growing evidence suggests that climate change could substantially alter forest disturbances. Interactions between individual disturbance agents are a major component of disturbance regimes, yet how interactions contribute to their climate sensitivity remains largely unknown. Objectives Here, our aim was to assess the climate sensitivity of disturbance interactions, focusing on wind and bark beetle disturbances. Methods We developed a process-based model of bark beetle disturbance, integrated into the dynamic forest landscape model iLand (already including a detailed model of wind disturbance). We evaluated the integrated model against observations from three wind events and a subsequent bark beetle outbreak, affecting 530.2 ha (3.8 {\%}) of a mountain forest landscape in Austria between 2007 and 2014. Subsequently, we conducted a factorial experiment determining the effect of changes in climate variables on the area disturbed by wind and bark beetles separately and in combination. Results iLand was well able to reproduce observations with regard to area, temporal sequence, and spatial pattern of disturbance. The observed disturbance dynamics was strongly driven by interactions, with 64.3 {\%} of the area disturbed attributed to interaction effects. A +4 °C warming increased the disturbed area by +264.7 {\%} and the area-weighted mean patch size by +1794.3 {\%}. Interactions were found to have a ten times higher sensitivity to temperature changes than main effects, considerably amplifying the climate sensitivity of the disturbance regime. Conclusions Disturbance interactions are a key component of the forest disturbance regime. Neglecting interaction effects can lead to a substantial underestimation of the climate change sensitivity of disturbance regimes.},

abstract = {One unexpected consequence of natural disturbances in forested areas is that managers often initiate activities that may impose greater ecosystem impacts than the disturbances themselves. By salvage logging areas affected by windstorms or other impacts, by harvesting host trees in advance of insect infestation or disease, or by preemptively harvesting forests in an attempt to improve their resilience to future disturbances and stresses, managers initiate substantial changes in the ecosystem structure and function. Much of this activity is undertaken in the absence of information on the qualitative and quantitative differences between disturbance impacts and harvesting. To provide insight for such decisions we evaluated the ecosystem consequences of two major disturbance processes in New England (U.S.A.)-intense windstorms and invasive pests and pathogens-and contrasted them with impacts from preemptive and salvage harvesting, Despite dramatic physical changes in forest structure resulting from hurricane impacts and insect infestation, little disruption of biogeochemical processes or other ecosystem functions typically follows these disturbances. Indeed, the physical and organic structures produced by these disturbances are important natural features providing habitat and landscape heterogeneity that are often missing due to centuries of land use. From an ecosystem perspective there are strong arguments against preemptive and salvage logging or the attempt through silvicultural means to improve the resistance or resilience of forests to disturbance and stress. There are often valid motivations for salvage or preemptive logging including financial considerations, human safety, and a desire to shape the long-term composition and resource-production characteristics of forests. Nonetheless, there are many ecological benefits derived from leaving forests alone when they are affected or threatened by disturbances and pest and pathogen outbreaks.},

abstract = {We present a retrospective method for studying forest disturbance regimes, and especially the role of windthrows, based on circular statistical models of directions of fallen logs. This approach was applied to fallen log data from three areas of pristine Picea abies-dominated boreal forests in northern Europe. The data consisted of 5 plots from each of the three areas, totaling 15 plots and covering an area of 24 ha. The disturbance history of the plots, which varied from area to area, was known from previous detailed studies. We selected and fitted the most suitable circular model for each plot, based on goodness-of-fit and the Akaike information criterion. For uneven-aged forests, the symmetric von Mises distribution, was best fitted, while for the even-aged forest the sine-skewed wrapped Cauchy distribution was selected. The degree of concentration around the mean direction of fallen trees was strongest for the late-successional even-aged forest most exposed to windthrow, while an uneven-aged forest with drought-driven mortality had the lowest concentration and the greatest variance over the mean directions. For the third area, characterized by an uneven age structure and tree mortality driven by heart-rot fungi in old trees in interaction with wind, an intermediate between these two were derived. Our results suggested the utility of circular distributions of fallen logs and their statistical models for retrospective assessments of forest disturbance regimes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The alpine landscape of the Tatra National Park has changed significantly over the past few decades, especially as a result of the development of tourism (i.e. hotels, ski slopes) which are likely to impede the effective management of nature conservation.This study presents the results of a survey to ascertain the preferences and the perception of visitors to the Tatra National Park and its landscape. Scenarios of tourism development and landscape changes were presented to respondents verbally and by means of manipulated photos in order to visualize potential threats to the current appearance of the landscape. The data that this survey revealed and the statements made by the respondents with regard to the frequency of their trips to the National Park were combined to assess the effects of landscape changes on the recreation benefits of visitors. Furthermore, the willingness-to-pay, in terms of a hypothetical admission fee to prevent a further degradation of the ecological quality, was also ascertained.The results show that the frequency of trips is significantly reduced if one of the scenarios were to become a fact. Annual recreation benefits (measured by the consumer surplus) currently amount to approximately EUR 1,040 per person, while the loss of recreation benefits, as a consequence of further changes to the landscape considered to be unfavourable by the respondents, would amount to EUR 329 to 475 per person. In addition, visitors stated an annual willingness to pay from EUR 23 to EUR 26 to prevent further negative developments. The conclusions that were drawn refer especially to the effectiveness of management in the Tatra National Park, to the combination of revealed and stated behaviour data, and the willingness-to-pay of the visitors.},

abstract = {Larger bark beetles such as Ips typographus (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) fly at about 2 m s-1 for up to several hours. Computer simulations in two dimensions showed that bark beetles are capable of dispersing from a brood tree over wide areas while drifting with the wind. For example, if beetles take an angle of maximum turn (AMT) at random up to 10°either left or right each second, about 90{\%} of the beetles become distributed over a 31.9 km2 area after 1 h of flight. Larger maximum turning angles by beetles decrease the area of dispersal in proportion to the reciprocal of the square of the AMT. An increase in the dispersal tame causes a linear increase in dispersal area and downwind drift distance, while increases in wind speed have no affect on the ultimate dispersal area but do increase the drift distance. Dispersal of bark beetles in a 10 x 10 km forest of 5 million trees of 0.15 m trunk radius, corresponding to the natural density and trunk size of a 70-year-old Norway spruce forest (Picea abies), was simulated by spacing trees at appropriate density in a 50 m radial area centred on a beetle. A new area with trees was constructed similarly whenever the beetle left the former area. These simulations showed trees reduced the size of the dispersal area by 11{\%} and downwind drift by 18{\%} after 1 h of flight due to the effect of turning some beetles back toward the release point, similar to the effects of increasing the AMT. The average dispersal distance and downwind distance decreased as linear functions of trunk density. Given step size, number of steps, and AMT, the correlated random walk equation of Kareiva and Shigesada [1983, Oecologia 56, 234-238] predicts mean squared dispersal distance. This can be transformed to the more meaningful average dispersal distance by taking the square root and multiplying by a proportion obtained from a three dimensional surface equation fitted from simulation results.},

We characterized the combined effects of climatic factors and densitydependent feedbacks on forest damage caused by Ips typographus (L.), one of the most destructive pests of European spruce forests, and tested whether climate modified the interannual variation in the altitudinal outbreak range of the species. We analyzed a 16- year time-series from the European Alps of timber loss in Picea abies Karsten forests due to I. typographus attacks and used a discrete population model and an information theoretic approach to compare multiple competing hypotheses. The occurrence of dry summers combined with warm temperatures appeared as the main abiotic triggers of severity of outbreaks. We also found an endogenous negative feedback with a 2-year lag suggesting a potential important role of natural enemies. Forest damage per hectare averaged 7-fold higher where spruce was planted in sites warmer than those within its historical climatic range. Dry summers, but not temperature, was related to upward shifts in the altitudinal outbreak range. Considering the potential increased susceptibility of spruce forests to insect outbreaks due to climate change, there is growing value in mitigating these effects through sustainable forest management, which includes avoiding the promotion of spruce outside its historical climatic range.},

abstract = {In the past several decades, a trend in forestry and silviculture has been toward promoting complexity in forest ecosystems, but how complexity is conceived and described has shifted over time as new ideas and terminology have been introduced. Historically, ecologically-focused silviculture has focused largely on manipulation of structural complexity, but often with the functional role of features in mind. Recently there has been a shift toward viewing complexity in an “adaptive” or “resilience” context, with a focus on understanding forests as complex adaptive systems. As new concepts and terminology are introduced it will be essential that silviculture researchers understand their dissemination into silviculture research, experimental design, and treatment implementation. With this goal in mind we set out to better understand: (1) how complexity terminology and ideas have shifted over time in silviculture, (2) how different conceptions of complexity have been incorporated into silviculture experiments and treatments, and (3) how various complexity concepts are being reconciled with each other in practice. We conducted a multi-stage review of the silvicultural literature for the time period 1992–2017 that included: (1) a broad keyword analysis, (2) a detailed review of a narrower subset of publications, and (3) a thorough review of a set of silvicultural experiments that included a focus on complexity in their design. We also developed a set of case studies that illustrate shifts in complexity conceptions in silvicultural experiment design and analysis. Our analysis indicates considerable lags in incorporation of complexity-focused terminology and ideas into silvicultural research and experimental treatment design. Very few silviculture-focused studies have incorporated adaptive complexity concepts explicitly into design or analysis, even though these concepts were introduced nearly a decade ago and are widely discussed in the literature. However, in our case studies we document how silviculture experiments and research programs that were not designed explicitly around complexity concepts have begun to incorporate these ideas into analysis of treatment outcomes. Silviculture researchers should focus on reconciling conceptions of complexity through analysis of existing experiments and with modeling studies, as well as attempting to better understand mechanistic relationships among structural, functional, and adaptive conceptions of complexity.},

abstract = {Landsat time series data sets were acquired for the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico. This area includes the San Pedro Parks Wilderness area, which was designated as an official wilderness in 1964. Eight autumnal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes acquired from 1988 to 2006 were analyzed to determine whether significant changes have occurred throughout the region during the past 18 years and, if so, to assess whether the changes are long-term and gradual or short-term and abrupt. It was found that, starting in about 1995, many of the conifer stands within the Wilderness area showed consistently gradual and marked increases in the Shortwave Infrared/Near Infrared Index. These trends generally imply decreases in canopy greenness or increases in mortality. Other high-elevation conifer forests located outside of the Wilderness area showed similar spectral trends, indicating that changes are potentially widespread. The spatial patterns of forest damage as inferred from the image analyses were very similar to the general patterns of insect defoliation damage mapped via aerial sketch mapping by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Health Monitoring Program. A field visit indicated that zones of spectral change are associated with high levels of forest damage and mortality, likely caused by a combination of insects and drought. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using historical Landsat data for providing objective and consistent long-term assessments of the gradual ecosystem changes that are occurring within the western United States.},

abstract = {Bark beetles cause significant tree mortality in coniferous forests across North America. Mapping beetle-caused tree mortality is therefore important for gauging impacts to forest ecosystems and assessing trends. Remote sensing offers the potential for accurate, repeatable estimates of tree mortality in outbreak areas. With the advancement of multi-temporal disturbance detection methods using Landsat data, the capability exists for improvement in mapping methods, yet more information is needed to determine the accuracy of these methods for mapping forest disturbances and to quantify differences between these methods and single-date image classification methods. We compared single-date (using maximum likelihood classification) to multi-date (using time series of spectral indices) classification methods of Landsat imagery and investigated how detection accuracy changed with varying levels of mortality severity. For each method, we evaluated several bands and/or spectral vegetation indices and identified the one that resulted in the highest accuracy. A fine-resolution classified aerial image within the Landsat scene was used as reference data for evaluation and comparison between methods. For the single-date image classification, we achieved a 91.0{\%} (kappa = 0.88) overall accuracy with 11.7{\%} omission and 2.3{\%} commission errors for the red stage (tree mortality) class using the tasseled cap transformation indices of brightness, greenness, and wetness. For the multi-date analysis, the Band5/Band4 anomaly produced the highest accuracy among spectral indices and resulted in a 89.6{\%} (kappa = 0.86) classification accuracy with 12.6{\%} omission and 7.1{\%} commission errors for the red stage class. We compared accuracies between the best single- and multi-date methods across a range of tree mortality within a pixel. The multi-date method was more accurate at intermediate levels of tree mortality, whereas the single-date method was more accurate at high mortality levels. Our results indicate that Landsat-based mapping of forest disturbances that use either single-date or multi-date methods can result in high classification accuracy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Science and reporting information needs for monitoring dynamics in land cover over time have prompted research, and made operational, a wide variety of change detection methods utilizing multiple dates of remotely sensed data. Change detection procedures based upon spectral values are common; however, landscape pattern analysis approaches which utilize spatial information inherent within imagery present opportunities for the generation of unique and ecologically important information. While the use of two images may provide the means to identify change, the use of more than two images for long-term monitoring affords the ability to identify a greater range of processes of landscape change, including rates and dynamics. The main objective of this review is to investigate and summarize the methods and applications of land cover spatial pattern analysis using three or more image dates. The potential and the limitations of landscape pattern indices are identifi ed and discussed to inform application recommendations. The second objective of this review is to make recommendations, including appropriate landscape pattern indices, for the application of landscape pattern analysis of a long time series of remotely sensed data to a case study involving the mountain pine beetle in British Columbia, Canada. The review concludes with recommendations for future research.},

abstract = {Historic land use can exert strong land-use legacies, i.e., long-lasting effects on ecosystems, but the importance of land-use legacies, alongside other factors, for subsequent forest-cover change is unclear. If past land use affects rates of forest disturbance and afforestation then this may constrain land use planning and land management options, and legacies of current land management may constrain future land use. Our goal was to assess if and how much land-use legacies affect contemporary forest disturbance, and the abundance of different forest types in the Carpathian region in Eastern Europe (265,000km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, encompassing parts of Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, and Czech Republic). We modeled contemporary forest disturbance (based on satellite image analysis from 1985 to 2010) as a function of historic land use (based on digitized topographic maps from 1860 and 1960). Contemporary forest disturbance was strongly related to historic land use even when controlling for environmental, accessibility and socio-political variation. Across the Carpathian region, the odds of forest disturbance were about 50{\%} higher in areas that were not forested in 1860 (new forests) compared to areas that were forested then (old forests). The forest disturbance in new forests was particularly high in Poland (88{\%} higher odds), Slovakia (69{\%}) and Romania (67{\%}) and persisted across the entire range of environmental, accessibility and socio-political variation. Reasons for the observed legacy effects may include extensive plantations outside forest ranges, predominantly spruce, poplar, and black locust, which are prone to natural disturbances. Furthermore, as plantations reach harvestable age of about 70 years for pulp and 120 year for saw-timber production, these are likely to be clear-cut, producing the observed legacy effects. Across the Carpathians, forest types shifted towards less coniferous cover in 2010 compared to the 1860s and 1960s likely due to extensive historic conifer harvest, and to recent natural disturbance events and clear-cuts of forest plantations. Our results underscore the importance of land-use legacies, and show that past land uses can greatly affect subsequent forest disturbance for centuries. Given rapid land use changes worldwide, it is important to understand how past legacies affect current management and what the impact of current land management decisions may be for future land use.},

abstract = {Large scale windstorms disturbed forest ecosystems in the Tatra Mountains in 2004, and were followed by a severe fire in 2005. A long-term study on the vegetation successional dynamics of the area was launched immediately after the 2005 event. Relev{\'{e}} plots were established under five different disturbance and management treatments: windthrow left, windthrow removed, hydrologically managed, burnt and reference. We used weighted Ellenberg's indicator plant values for ordination analyses of the following environmental gradients: light, temperature, continentality, moisture, acidity, nitrogen. Successional patterns depended on the management treatment. Heavily burnt areas were colonized by plants disseminated by airborn diasporas, mainly by Chamaerion angustifolium, less burnt or unburnt localities were settled by plants germinating from the soil seed bank or by plants surviving by root system. Nitrophilous weed vegetation invaded plots with increased moisture (fallen or standing overstory vegetation or irrigated by man-made system) and nitrogen (burnt or windthrow removal). The felled-area species were recorded in each plot. Abundant natural regeneration was observed in plots with increased moisture. The moss layer disappeared soon after the disturbance events. The results presented here refer to a very early successional stage, new insights into initial successional paterns are gained.},

abstract = {Heavy natural disturbance in large protected areas of former commercial forests increasingly evokes European parliaments to call for management intervention because a loss of habitats and species is feared. In contrast, natural early successional habitats have recently been recognised as important for conservation. Current knowledge in this field mostly results from studies dealing only with selected taxa. Here we analyse the success of species across 24 lineages of three kingdoms in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany) after 15 years of a European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) outbreak that led to rapid canopy opening. Using indicator species analysis, we found 257 species with a significant preference for open forests and 149 species with a preference for closed forests, but only 82 species with a preference for the stand conditions transitional between open and closed forests. The large number of species with a preference for open forests across lineages supports the role of this bark beetle as a keystone species for a broad array of species. The slowdown of the outbreak after 15 years in the core zone of the national park resulted in less than half of the area being affected, due to variability in stand ages and tree species mixtures. Our case study is representative of the tree species composition and size of many large protected montane areas in Central European countries and illustrates that (1) natural disturbances increase biodiversity in formerly managed forests and (2) a montane protected area spanning 10,000 ha of low range mountains is likely sufficient to allow natural disturbances without a biased loss of closed-forest species. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {Montane Norway spruce forests of Central Europe have a very long tradition of use for timber production; however, recently there has been increasing concern for their role in maintaining biological diversity. This concern, coupled with recent severe windstorms that led to wide-spread bark beetle outbreaks, has brought the management of montane spruce forests to the forefront of public policy discussions in Central Europe. In order to shed light on the natural development and current structure of mature montane spruce forests, we established four 0.25ha research plots in a semi-natural montane spruce forest in the ??umava Mountains (The Bohemian Forest), Czech Republic. We mapped all trees, extracted increment cores for age and growth-pattern analyses, and inventoried all current tree regeneration, including the substrates on which it was found. Stands were characterized by uni-modal tree diameter distributions and high basal areas (56.6m2ha-1 on average), indicating a natural transition from the stem exclusion phase towards the understory reinitiation phase. The stands showed largely single-cohort recruitment age structures, however, with recruitment spanning seven decades. Our analyses suggest that this cohort existed as advance regeneration prior to major disturbances in the late 1800s, which included post-bark beetle salvage logging. Spatial pattern analyses of living and dead stems combined, showed an increase in uniformity of living trees, pointing to the role of natural density-dependent mortality. However, past growth patterns and historical documentation suggest that low intensity canopy disturbances (wind and snow) also caused mortality and diversified canopy structure. Because the stands developed naturally over the past 120+ years and thus escaped thinning operations, high volumes of coarse woody debris (94m3ha-1) and snag densities (546stemsha-1) have accrued. Advance spruce regeneration was quite abundant and existed primarily on deadwood substrates, even though these occupied only a small percent of stand area. Because of salvage logging in the late 1880s, these stands do not qualify, according to the traditional paradigm, as natural spruce forests. As a result, they are recently subject to active management practices including salvage logging that remove dead and dying trees. Given the importance of deadwood for forest regeneration and recovery from disturbance, as demonstrated in this study, we argue that dead wood removal may limit future natural regeneration in these stands. Thus, the purported benefits of removing dead and dying trees from semi-natural forests must be carefully weighed against the potential detrimental impacts on natural spruce forest regeneration and biodiversity. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The survey and continuing inventory in the Bavarian Forest National Park of deadwood areas resulting from a spruce bark beetle calamity are being performed by means of visual evaluation of colour infrared aerial pho- tographs. With the aid of the object-oriented image anal- ysis software eCognition, it was possible to develop a partially automated method for this purpose. In order to verify the classification results, a test area was classified, and the results compared with those obtained by the pre- viously used method. In addition, the classification results from two consecutive years were compared, and accuracy assessment methods were used to scrutinize the results. Classification in the deadwood areas yielded a total clas- sification accuracy of 91.5{\%}. In regard to objectivity and degree of detail, the newly developed method is signifi- cantly superior to the former method, which is based on visual interpretation with a stereo workstation. One prob- lem, however, was the insufficient spatial accuracy of the respective orthophotos. Because of this, it was not possible to detect changes over the course of specified time inter- vals. Therefore, a practical application of this method would require that the orthophotos from various dates or times be precisely spatially assigned. This requirement can be achieved with the production of new orthophotos.},

Forty-eight patients underwent pulmonary resection, and the remaining 58 were given chemotherapy and/or best supportive care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were the predictive factors of survival and recurrence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the 35.9-month median follow-up period, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 54.6{\%} and 30.4{\%}. On multivariate analysis, absence of adjuvant chemotherapy after pulmonary metastases (p = 0.003), presence of extrapulmonary metastases (p = 0.001), elevated prelaparotomy serum CEA level (p = 0.015), and absence of pulmonary resection (p = 0.048) were independent prognostic factors for poor overall survival. In patients who underwent pulmonary resection, the 3-year pulmonary recurrence-free survival rate was 78.3{\%}. On multivariate analysis, elevated prelaparotomy serum CEA level (p = 0.018) and disease-free interval ≤ 12 months (p = 0.008) were independent risk factors associated with pulmonary re-recurrence after pulmonary resection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: This study took place at a single institution and had a small sample size.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Although we admit, to some degree, the benefits of the selection mechanism, pulmonary metastasectomy from colorectal cancer may improve survival after curative resection of colorectal cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy, extrapulmonary metastases, and prelaparotomy CEA value are independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Prelaparotomy serum CEA level may be an especially reliable predictor of both overall survival and recurrence-free survival after pulmonary metastasectomy in patients who undergo curative resection for colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Pathogen and pest outbreaks are recognized as key processes in the dynamics of Western forest ecosystems, yet the spatial patterns of stress and mortality are often complex and difficult to describe in an explicit spatial context, especially when considering the concurrent effects of multiple agents. Blister rust, a fungal pathogen, and mountain pine beetle, an insect pest, are two dominant sources of stress and mortality to high-altitude whitebark pine within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). In whitebark pine populations infested with blister rust or mountain pine beetle, the shift from green to red needles at the outer-most branches is an early sign of stress and infestation. In this analysis, we investigated a method that combines field surveys with a remote sensing classification and spatial analysis to differentiate the effects of these two agents of stress and mortality within whitebark pine. Hyperspectral remotely sensed images from the airborne HyMap sensor were classified to determine the locations of stress and mortality in whitebark pine crowns through sub-pixel mixture-tuned matched-filter analysis in three areas of the GYE in September 2000 and July 2006. Differences in the spatial pattern of blister rust and mountain pine beetle infestation allowed us to separate areas dominated by mountain pine beetle versus blister rust by examining changes in the spatial scale of significant stress and mortality clusters computed by the Ripley's K algorithm. At two field sites the distance between clusters of whitebark pine stress and mortality decreased from 2000 to 2006, indicating domination by the patchy spatial pattern of blister rust infestation. At another site, the distance between significant stress and mortality clusters increased from 2000 to 2006, indicating that the contiguous pattern of mountain pine beetle infestation was the primary source of disturbance. Analysis of these spatial stress and mortality patterns derived from remote sensing yields insight to the relative importance of blister rust and mountain pine beetle dynamics in the landscape. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Repeated windthrows and consequent bark beetle outbreaks have damaged almost 20,000 hectares of mature Norway spruce forests, what is a half of the National Park forest area. Current I. typographus population size and its response to the environment and to forestry defense measures attract attention of all stakeholders involved in natural resource management, including public. In this paper we analyse the potential I. typographus population size in two consecutive years 2014 and 2015, which represented a climatologically normal year and an extremely hot year, respectively. We used bark temperature and phenology models to estimate the number of generations developed in each year. In 2014, the average bark temperature of standing living trees at study sites was 14.5 °C, in 2015 it increased to 15.7 °C. The bark temperature of fallen logs was 17.7 °C in 2014, and 19.5 °C in 2015. The bark temperature of standing living trees allowed to develop one and two generations in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The elevated bark temperature of fallen logs allowed to develop two generations in 2014 and three generations in 2015. The good match between the predicted and observed timing of each generation emergence as well as the large increase in the number of catches in pheromone traps in 2015 indicated a dramatic increase of the I. typographus population in the extremely warm year, especially at the unmanaged windthrown site.},

abstract = {The provisioning of ecosystem services to society is increasingly under pressure from global change. Changing disturbance regimes are of particular concern in this context due to their high potential impact on ecosystem structure, function and composition. Resilience-based stewardship is advocated to address these changes in ecosystem management, but its operational implementation has remained challenging. We review observed and expected changes in disturbance regimes and their potential impacts on provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services, concentrating on temperate and boreal forests. Subsequently, we focus on resilience as a powerful concept to quantify and address these changes and their impacts, and present an approach towards its operational application using established methods from disturbance ecology. We suggest using the range of variability concept – characterizing and bounding the long-term behaviour of ecosystems – to locate and delineate the basins of attraction of a system. System recovery in relation to its range of variability can be used to measure resilience of ecosystems, allowing inferences on both engineering resilience (recovery rate) and monitoring for regime shifts (directionality of recovery trajectory). It is important to consider the dynamic nature of these properties in ecosystem analysis and management decision-making, as both disturbance processes and mechanisms of resilience will be subject to changes in the future. Furthermore, because ecosystem services are at the interface between natural and human systems, the social dimension of resilience (social adaptive capacity and range of variability) requires consideration in responding to changing disturbance regimes in forests. Synthesis and applications. Based on examples from temperate and boreal forests we synthesize principles and pathways for fostering resilience to changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. We conclude that future work should focus on testing and implementing these pathways in different contexts to make ecosystem services provisioning more robust to changing disturbance regimes and advance our understanding of how to cope with change and uncertainty in ecosystem management.},

abstract = {The incidence of natural disturbance in forests is increasing globally as a consequence of global warming. The concomitant large-scale transformation of landscapes can have profound social impacts and trigger political conflict that hampers resource management. This paper explores the link between landscape transformations and political conflict using the example of the bark beetle epidemic in Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. For a significant part of the local population, the bark beetle represented a threat to their homeland and the post-disturbance landscape of dead wood reflected the dominance of outside interests in land management. This resentment sparked the formation of a local political movement, which was successful in pressing for changes in the current land management policy that were based on the ideal of a green forest landscape that needed to be protected by human intervention. An alternative interpretation of the post-disturbance landscape, however, welcomed it as a step towards authentic wilderness and opposed interventions to control the bark beetle. These contrasting understandings of the post-disturbance landscape underpin the protracted political conflict over the appropriate management of natural disturbance that has been smouldering for more than 20 years. The article concludes that it is vital to understand the cultural meaning of landscapes before adopting a disturbance management policy in order to avoid paralysing political conflict and social unrest. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Long-term changes in climate substantially affect the tree growth and species distribution in Europe. In the presented study, the radial growth of Fagus sylvatica (L.) and Picea abies ((L.) Karst.) has been studied along an altitudinal gradient covering six vegetation formations characteristic for sub-montane, montane and high-montane conditions of the western Carpathians. Tree growth responses to temperature and precipitation changes have been analysed based on the sample of increment cores and standard dendroclimatic methods in two time periods, the reference period 1961–1990 and the recent period 1991–2012. The growth responses of spruce and beech to recent changes in climate were similar up to high-montane zones, where the beech shows significantly larger improvements of radial increments in comparison to spruce. The growth responses were mainly temperature driven. In the sub-montane area, the increased effect of precipitation in the recent period was overridden by the negative effects of warming, and the alleviated temperature limitation had an evidently supportive effect on tree growth in montane and high-montane areas. In the near future, the warming will likely cause decline in radial increments of beech and spruce in sub-montane areas due to expected landscape drying. At the same time, the improved competitive ability of beech in the high-montane zones suggests a shift in the leading edge of beech distribution into higher altitudes in East-Central Europe.},

In order to assess the present danger of IAS spread, we examined 23 Czech sites of community importance (SCI) within Natura 2000 protected areas (PA) over 2015 and mapped the occurrence of four IAS: Solidago spp. (goldenrod), Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam), Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) and Fallopia spp. (Japanese knotweed). The model areas were divided into five monitoring zones, graded by conservation importance and habitat disturbance level (core area [A], broader core area [B], semi-natural habitat [C], anthropogenically affected habitat [D], anthropogenically degraded habitat [E]). Despite a high number of IAS occurrences (3222 localities), habitats of European importance (zone A) showed a relatively low level of invasion ({\textless} 0.3{\%} total area). Highest IAS occurrence number was in SCI border areas and disturbed habitats (zones C and E). There was a significant positive correlation between level of invasion inside and outside SCIs, related to human activities such as logging and urbanisation. A strong effect for watercourse vicinity was noted for the occurrence of I. glandulifera and Fallopia spp.; but not for H. mantegazzianum and Solidago spp. A stratified management approach, employing zones delimitation to assess what threat pose IAS to the PA objects of conservation, can be useful to prioritize control measures in IAS local action plans.},

abstract = {Natura 2000 is a unique EU-wide network of protected areas, which aims to maintain European biodiversity or at least prevent its worsening based on two Directives: Bird Directive 79/409/EEC and Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC. It is assumed that this will assure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats. The new member states implemented the Natura 2000 Directives in their own legislation as a part of the EU-integration process. Here we present the practical difficulties of implementing these directives in the Czech Republic as a warning of the problems likely to be encountered in post-communist countries. Our results are mainly based on a case study of the {\v{S}}umava National Park. We analyze, why Natura 2000 may not work here and look for possible solutions, which would require changes in Natura 2000 policies and their implementation in national policies. We show five examples of activities, which were performed or are still planned despite the fact that Natura 2000 evaluations have clearly shown that they have or would have had significant negative effects on Natura 2000 habitats and species. These include canoeing in pearl mussels core zones, logging of spruce stands, park zonation and management, and ski lift and tourist trails in capercaillie core zones. We deduce that the unstable political conditions together with the weak position of the state representatives in the Czech Republic result in a situation in which the last remnants of justice together with newly implemented EU directives easily disappear. We then show that the problems encountered in implementing Natura 2000 directives in the Czech Republic are likely to affect their successful implementation in most other post-communist countries. EU is supporting these countries financially, but this support should be much more conditional on full implementation of EU laws. Environmental subsidies should be conditional on fulfilment of the country's obligations to EU nature protection. Proper use of EU money should be directly controlled by central EU authorities, not left entirely to the recipients, the member states.},

abstract = {The question, whether the forest management adopted in several European national parks following natural disturbances (windstorms, bark beetle) is in the long term the optimal one is currently widely discussed in a pan-European context. Instead of a clear management policy, however, only non-compulsory recommendations are suggested and management directives are missing. For example, it is established that non-intervention management is optimal for preserving biodiversity in mountain spruce stands, as logging diminishes biodiversity, but no such recommendation has been passed on to the managers of these stands. In the absence of such guidance park managers adopt various suboptimal strategies, which depend on who owns a particular area of the forest (private or state-owned) and their priorities. Here we present an example of this: the differences between the management practices applied by state and private owners in the central part of the {\v{S}}umava NP. Using aerial photographs, we evaluated the effect of these practices by comparing the status of Natura 2000 habitats in 2004 (when the Natura 2000 area was designated), with that in 2011 (four years after the Kyrill wind storm, when the post-wind storm activities had more or less finished). The private owner logged and removed trees from significantly larger areas than the {\v{S}}umava NP Authority. However, even management by the {\v{S}}umava NP Authority was sometimes suboptimal: they managed some valuable habitats in a similar way to those of lower conservation value. We conclude that a clear definition of the long-term management strategy for national parks, obligatory on all owners, is critically important for the management of Natura 2000 habitats. A consensus of state representatives, regional politicians, scientists and all other stakeholders, expressed in obligatory international directives, is needed in order to guarantee that in the future the status of Natura 2000 habitats will still be favourable (required by the Habitats Directive, Article 6). Specifically, the managers of Natura 2000 sites would appreciate clearer European Commission guidance on how to maintain the favourable status of the stands in the areas under their control.},

Stăncioiu et al. (2018) made an important contribution by assessing forest connectivity based on tree species populations in Romania. Their study concluded that current management policies and inherited guidelines from the past likely promoted the conservation of regional biodiversity. In this viewpoint paper, we present a different perspective on their conclusion. We show that current management policies are threatening biodiversity in Romania, and changes in forest management policies are urgently needed to halt the loss of habitats of protected species. Although recent management policies likely did lead to good tree species connectivity, habitats of protected species are becoming increasingly fragmented by logging. Adopting policies to protect forest habitats of protected species, limiting large-scale salvage logging within protected areas, and restricting road building to reduce forest fragmentation are crucial steps towards the long-term persistence of biodiversity hotspots in the Romanian Carpathians.},

abstract = {IntroductionChanges in socio-economy and climate are affecting the demand of wood products globally. At the same time, society requires that forest supporting structures like biodiversity are maintained and preserved while the demand for wood products is also covered. Management support systems, like forest simulation models, that are able to analyze connections as well as quantify trade-offs between forest structure management and biodiversity indicators are highly sought. However, such models are generally developed for the local plot or stand scale only and ecosystem-scale analyses are missing. In this study, we analyzed ways to interpret results from the single-tree forest simulator SILVA from the local to the ecosystem scale. We also analyzed the impacts of forest management on biodiversity using two species diversity indicators, the species profile index and the species intermingling, for scenarios adapted from the GLOBIOM model in the case study “Augsburg Western Forests”, a high productive region in South-Germany. In order to evaluate diversity tendencies across the ecosystem, we applied a moving window methodology.ResultsThe relevance of scale for the interpretation of management effects on species diversity was shown and clear differences between scenarios revealed. The differences between scenarios were particularly visible when comparing the two diversity indicators, especially because the species profile index focuses on vertical and horizontal information and the species intermingling focuses mainly on horizontal structures. Under a multifunctional scenario, biodiversity values could be preserved at all scales in the vertical dimension. However, under a bio-energy-oriented scenario diversity at the local scale was reduced, although at the ecosystem level, and only in the horizontal dimension, diversity remained at relatively high values.ConclusionsWith this work, we can conclude that integrative modeling, with multiple scenarios, is highly needed to support forestry decision making and towards the evolution of forest management to consider the ecosystem scale, especially when the optimization of diversity is a management priority.},

To avoid failure of global initiatives dedicated to reducing the loss of species, five key policy reforms are necessary: (1) salvage logging must be banned from protected areas; (2) forest planning should address altered disturbance regimes for all intact forests to ensure that significant areas remain undisturbed by logging; (3) new kinds of integrated analyses are needed to assess the potential economic benefits of salvage logging against its ecological, economic, and social costs; (4) global and regional maps of natural disturbance regimes should be created to guide better spatio-temporal planning of protected areas and undisturbed forests outside reserves; and (5) improved education and communication programs are needed to correct widely-held misconceptions about natural disturbances},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. Context: Multi-objective management can mitigate conflicts among land-use objectives. However, the effectiveness of a multi-objective solution depends on the spatial scale at which land-use is optimized. This is because the ecological variation within the planning region influences the potential for site-specific prioritization according to the different objectives. Objectives: We optimized the allocation of forest management strategies to maximize the joint production of two conflicting objectives, timber production and carbon storage, at increasing spatial scales. We examined the impacts of the extent of the planning region on the severity of the conflict, the potential for its mitigation, and the strategies that were identified as optimal. Methods: Using forecasted data from a forest simulator, we constructed Pareto frontiers optimizing the joint provision of the objectives in production forests in Finland. Optimization was conducted within increasing hierarchical spatial scales and outcomes were compared in terms of the severity of the conflict and the solution to mitigate it. Results: The trade-offs between timber production and carbon storage appeared less severe and could be mitigated more effectively the larger the planning regions were, but the improvements became minor beyond the scale of ‘large forest holding'. The results thus indicate that this scale, approximately 100 stands or 200 ha, is large enough to effectively mitigate the conflict between timber production and carbon storage. Conclusions: Management planning over relatively small forest areas (200 ha) can mitigate ecosystem service trade-offs effectively. Thus the effective use of multi-objective optimization tools may be feasible even in small-scale forestry.},

abstract = {In the 1990s, a bark beetle (Ips typographus) outbreak caused a dieback of semi-natural mountain spruce (Picea abies) forests in the {\v{S}}umava National Park (Czech Republic). Two different approaches were applied to the attacked forests: (1) a small portion of the stands in the core zone of the national park was left without intervention, relying upon natural regeneration, and (2) traditional technical measures were adopted, in which attacked trees were felled and removed. Under the dead canopy of the stands left without intervention, there was a good regeneration of spruce and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and, sporadically, beech (Fagus sylvatica). In clear-cut areas, the numbers of spruce and rowan were significantly lower than under the dead canopy. Pioneer species such as willow (Salix aurita), birch (Betula pubescens), and aspen (Populus tremula) appeared in the clear-cut areas. The dependence of spruce regeneration on the availability of suitable microhabitats was found: decaying wood and spruce litter was found as the most favourable. The results confirmed that the original tree species of the mountain spruce forests regenerate well under dead canopy. The bark beetle outbreak does not result in the complete loss of the forests and could even be considered as a tool for the restoration of their natural character. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Incorporating an understanding of natural disturbance and stand development processes more fully into silvicultural practice is the basis for an ecological forestry approach. Such an approach must include 1) understanding the importance of biological legacies created by a tree regenerating disturbance and incorporating legacy management into harvesting prescriptions; 2) recognizing the role of stand development processes, particularly individual tree mortality, in generating structural and compositional heterogeneity in stands and implementing thinning prescriptions that enhance this heterogeneity; and 3) appreciating the role of recovery periods between disturbance events in the development of stand complexity. We label these concepts, when incorporated into a comprehensive silvicultural approach, the “three-legged stool” of ecological forestry. Our goal in this report is to review the scientific basis for the three-legged stool of ecological forestry to provide a conceptual foundation for its wide implementation.},

Yet, sustainability science has developed largely independently from and with little reference to key ecological principles that govern life on Earth. A macroecological perspective highlights three principles that should be integral to sustainability science: 1) physical conservation laws govern the flows of energy and materials between human systems and the environment, 2) smaller systems are connected by these flows to larger systems in which they are embedded, and 3) global constraints ultimately limit flows at smaller scales. Over the past few decades, decreasing per capita rates of consumption of petroleum, phosphate, agricultural land, fresh water, fish, and wood indicate that the growing human population has surpassed the capacity of the Earth to supply enough of these essential resources to sustain even the current population and level of socioeconomic development.},

Currently used methods of solar insolation computation are based mainly on vector data represented by isosurfaces or raster data representing a digital elevation model. Our solution is focused on detailed point cloud data that express the complex objects such are real trees. We propose to convert input point cloud data into the form of regular 3D grid based on voxels. The result of the paper is also methodology for sunlight analysis with comprehensive steps of computation including transformation between the coordinate reference system of point cloud data and the local coordinate system of 3D raster grid, as well as transformation of the Sun coordinates in the equatorial coordinate system to the horizontal coordinates azimuth and altitude (elevation) and following transformation into the local coordinate system of 3D raster grid.},

abstract = {The causes and resulting spatial patterns of Siberian pine mortality in eastern Kuznetzky Alatau Mountains, Siberia were analyzed based on satellite (Landsat, MODIS) and dendrochronology data. Climate variables studied included temperature, precipitation and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) drought index. Landsat data analysis showed that stand mortality was first detected in the year 2006 at an elevation of 650m, and extended up to 900m by the year 2012. Mortality was accompanied by a decrease in MODIS-derived vegetation index (EVI). The area of dead stands and the upper mortality line were correlated with increased drought. The uphill margin of mortality was limited by elevational precipitation gradients. Dead stands (i.e., {\textgreater}75{\%} tree mortality) were located mainly on southern slopes. With respect to slope, mortality was observed within a 7-20° range with greatest mortality occurring on convex terrain. Tree radial increment measurements correlate and were synchronous with SPEI (r2=0.37, rs=80). The results also showed the primary role of drought stress on Siberian pine mortality. A secondary role may be played by bark beetles and root fungi attacks. The observed Siberian pine mortality is part of a broader phenomenon of "dark needle conifers" (DNC, i.e., Siberian pine, fir and spruce) decline and mortality in European Russia, Siberia, and the Russian Far East. All locations of DNC decline coincided with areas of observed drought increase. The results obtained are one of the first observations of drought-induced decline and mortality of DNC at the southern border of boreal forests. Meanwhile if model projections of increased aridity are correct DNC within the southern part of its areal may be replaced by drought-resistant Pinus silvestris and Larix sibirica. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Existing approaches for the assessment of forest management intensity lack a widely accepted, purely quantitative measure for ranking a set of forest stands along a gradient of management intensity. We have developed a silvicultural management intensity indicator (SMI) which combines three main characteristics of a given stand: tree species, stand age and aboveground, living and dead wooden biomass. Data on these three factors are used as input to represent the risk of stand loss, which is a function of tree species and stand age, and stand density, which is a function of the silvicultural regime, stand age and tree species. Consequently, the indicator consists of a risk component (SMIr) and a density component (SMId). We used SMI to rank traditional management of the main Central European tree species: Norway spruce (Picea abies [Karst.] L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and oak (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea L.). By analysing SMI over their whole rotation period, we found the following ranking of management intensity: oak{\textless}beech{\textless}pine«spruce. Additionally, we quantified the SMI of actual research plots of the German Biodiversity exploratories, which represent unmanaged and managed forest stands including conifer forests cultivated outside their natural range. SMI not only successfully separate managed from unmanaged forests, but also reflected the variability of forest management and stand properties across the entire sample and within the different management groups. We suggest using SMI to quantify silvicultual management intensity of stands differing in species composition, age, silvicultural system (even-aged vs. uneven-aged), thinning grade and stages of stand conversion from one stand type into another. Using SMI may facilitate the assessment of the impact of forest management intensity on biodiversity in temperate forests},

abstract = {1 Understanding spatio-temporal processes of bark beetle infestations is crucial for predicting beetle behaviour and aiding management decisions aiming to prevent or mitigate tree mortality. We recorded the spatial and temporal distribution of killed trees during the 5-year period of an Ips acuminatus outbreak. 2 Killed trees were always grouped in well-defined patches (infestation spots). In years of high population density, infestation spots were large and aggregated, whereas, in years of low density, infestation spots were small and weakly aggregated or randomly distributed within the study area. 3 Most trees were killed in the spring by beetles that had hibernated but, in some years, trees were also killed in the summer by new-generation beetles originating from spring attacks. Spring-killed trees always formed new infestation spots at new locations (i.e. spot proliferation). By contrast, summer-killed trees always occurred at the edge of active spots established in the spring, thus resulting in spot growth. 4 With regard to management strategies, the results obtained in the present study suggest that areas located in close proximity to infestations of the previous year should be prioritized for risk assessment. Because large spots account for most of the observed tree mortality, the cut-and-remove method should be focused on these spots as soon as crown discoloration appears in the summer. If applied timely, this strategy will remove the new-generation beetles originating from the spring attacks before they emerge and also reduce the risk of spot growth.},

We investigated landscape-level patterns of Norway spruce mortality caused by Ips typographus outbreaks across three periods from 1999-2012 in Tatra National Park (Poland) using high-resolution aerial orthophotos and satellite imagery. Shifts in tree mortality related to elevation, slope, and solar equinox radiation were analyzed with ANOVAs (Tukey's HSD tests). Boosted regression trees were employed to assess the forecasting effectiveness of these variables related to mortality period. Spruce mortality severity increased significantly across time in both managed and unmanaged forests. Management activities did not effectively reduce spruce mortality severity. Mortality severity increased significantly at higher elevations over time, while slope and radiation trends varied. Elevation and radiation were the best forecasters of mortality period, exhibiting moderate predictive ability. Beetle-induced spruce mortality increased significantly in Tatra National Park from 1999-2012, particularly at high elevations. Management strategies aimed at minimizing spruce mortality have been ineffective. {\textcopyright} 2017, Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The accuracy of a land cover classification is the degree to which the map land cover agrees with the reference land cover classification (i.e. ground condition). The basic sampling designs historically implemented for map accuracy assessment have served well for the error matrix based analyses traditionally used. But contemporary applications of land cover maps place greater demands on accuracy assessment, and sampling designs must be constructed to target objectives such as accuracy of land cover composition and landscape pattern. Sampling designs differ in their suitability to achieve different objectives, and trade-offs among desirable sampling design criteria must be recognized and accommodated when selecting a design. An overview is presented of the sampling designs used in accuracy assessment, and the status of these designs is appraised for meeting current needs. Sampling design features that facilitate multiple-objective accuracy assessments are described.},

abstract = {1. During range expansions of phytophagous insects, secondary or novel hosts may allow colonisation of areas without primary hosts. Because plant species often differ in their relative attractiveness and suitability for insects, insect preference for, and performance on, these hosts can determine recruitment potential in the current and future expansion areas.  2. This study explores the relative roles of female preference and larval performance in an important pine defoliator, Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis {\&} Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae), which colonises three Pinus species at its current range margin in the Italian Alps: P. nigra (primary host), P. sylvestris (secondary host), and P. mugo (novel host).  3. Host use patterns in multiple insect populations were studied through choice and no-choice oviposition experiments in cages, field surveys of mixed stands, and laboratory and field monitoring of larval growth and mortality. It was predicted that a specific life-history trait - time limitation of short-lived females to lay a single batch of eggs - would act as a component of female performance, and lead to similar rates of host acceptance in no-choice settings.  4. In the choice experiment, P. nigra was accepted the most frequently while P. sylvestris was accepted the least frequently, confirming nest density patterns in the field. Contrary to prediction, females remained discriminating in no-choice settings in spite of time limitation. In contrast, relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality of larvae did not differ significantly among the three hosts, highlighting a discrepancy between female preference and larval performance.  5. Recruitment potential of T. pityocampa in future expansion into stands of P. sylvestris and P. mugo is evaluated by combining host quality, conservatism in oviposition behaviour, habitat suitability, and the opportunity for local adaptation.},

abstract = {After the windstorm of November 2004, the ground beetle assemblages (Coleoptera, Carabidae) differentiated after the windstorm into four groups reflecting degree of damaging and forestry management (intact stand, fallen timber in situ, extracted timber, fire). The stand with fallen timber reduced abundances of original species. Removal of timber eliminated sensitive forest species and favored tolerant species, whereas the fire allowed invasions of field species. Later, the assemblages on burned sites converged to those in the unburned sites. Their restoration has a sigmoid-like course. Independently on the above differentiation and course assemblage succession, episodes of severe drought resulted with a 1-2-years delay in sudden decline of number of individuals and species. Their numbers were restoring after longer humid periods. Because these extremes occur with a considerable regularity, the observed extremes of fluctuations of number of species and individuals represent the variability limits of the Carabid assemblages in such conditions. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index was shown, using the cross-correlation of SPEI and number of individuals and species of Carabids, as a suitable means to explain and predict such changes for the period of 1-2 years.},

In this paper, we review remote sensing implementations of support vector machines (SVMs), a promising machine learning methodology. This review is timely due to the exponentially increasing number of works published in recent years. SVMs are particularly appealing in the remote sensing field due to their ability to generalize well even with limited training samples, a common limitation for remote sensing applications. However, they also suffer from parameter assignment issues that can significantly affect obtained results. A summary of empirical results is provided for various applications of over one hundred published works (as of April, 2010). It is our hope that this survey will provide guidelines for future applications of SVMs and possible areas of algorithm enhancement. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany Timber use in central Europe is expected to increase in the future, in line with forest policy goals to strengthen local wood supply for CO 2 -neutral energy production, construction and other uses. Growing stocks in low-elevation forests in Switzerland are currently high as exemplified by the Swiss canton of Aargau, for which an average volume of 346 ± 16 m 3  ha −1  was measured in the 3rd Swiss National forest inventory (NFI) in 2004–2006. While this may justify a reduction of growing stocks through increased timber harvesting, we asked whether such a strategy may conflict with the sustainability of timber production and conservation goals. We evaluated a range of operationally relevant forest management scenarios that varied with respect to rotation length, growing stock targets and the promotion of conifers in the regeneration. The scenarios aimed at increased production of softwood, energy wood, the retention of potential habitat trees (PHTs) and the conversion to a continuous cover management system. They were used to drive the inventory-based forest simulator MASSIMO for 100 years starting in 2007 using the NFI sampling plots in Aargau. We analyzed model outputs with respect to projected future growing stock, growth, timber and energy yield and harvesting costs. We found growing stock to drop to 192 m 3  ha −1  in 2106 if business-as-usual (BAU as observed between the 2nd and 3rd NFI) timber volumes were set as harvesting targets for the whole simulation period. The promotion of conifers and a reduction of rotation lengths in a softwood scenario yielded 25{\%} more timber over the whole simulation period than BAU. An energy wood scenario that reduced growing stock to 200 m 3  ha −1  by 2056 and promoted the natural broadleaved regeneration yielded 9{\%} more timber than BAU before 2056 and 30{\%} less thereafter due to decreasing increments. The softwood scenario resulted in higher energy yield than the energy wood scenario despite the lower energy content of softwood. Retaining PHT resulted in a reduction of timber harvest (0.055 m 3  ha −1  yr −1  per habitat tree) and higher harvesting costs. Continuous cover management yielded moderate timber amounts throughout the simulation period, yet sustainably. Considering climate change, we discuss the risks associated with favoring drought- and disturbance-susceptible conifers at low elevations and emphasize that continuous cover management must allow for the regeneration of drought-adapted tree species. In conclusion, our simulations show potential for short-term increases in timber mobilization but also that such increases need to be carefully balanced with future forest productivity and other forest ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Standing Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees attacked by the spruce bark beetle are often logged to reduce the risk of future bark beetle attacks. This study focuses on the potential ecological value of such trees. The study was conducted in six reserves in Sweden that were hit by a storm in 1995 and suffered from tree mortality caused by the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.) (Col.; Curculionidae). The volumes of storm-felled trees and of standing trees killed by the spruce bark beetle were recorded during 5 years after the storm. In the present study five of the six reserves were revisited in 2006. Of the dead standing wood, 81{\%} was created by the spruce bark beetle, while 19{\%} constituted of stumps from trees broken by the storm. Thirty-seven per cent of the beetle-killed trees remained standing in 2006, 8-9 years after tree death. A significantly higher frequency of fruiting bodies of Fomitopsis pinicola on broken snags compared with on intact snags indicates that the rot caused by this fungus contributed to tree fall. Almost 30{\%} of the bark remained on both intact and fallen snags. The ecological value of snags created by the spruce bark beetle is discussed.},

abstract = {Bark beetles use aggregation pheromones to promote group foraging, thus increasing the chances of an individual to find a host and, when relevant, to overwhelm the defences of healthy trees. When a male beetle finds a suitable host, it releases pheromones that attract potential mates as well as other 'spying' males, which result in aggregations on the new host. To date, most studies have been concerned with the use of aggregation pheromones by bark beetles to overcome the defences of living, well-protected trees. How insects behave when facing undefended or poorly defended hosts remains largely unknown. The spatio-temporal pattern of resource colonization by the European eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, was quantified when weakly defended hosts (fallen trees) were attacked. In many of the replicates, colonization began with the insects rapidly scattering over the available surface and then randomly filling the gaps until a regular distribution was established, which resulted in a constant decrease in nearest-neighbour distances to a minimum below which attacks were not initiated. The scattered distribution of the first attacks suggested that the trees were only weakly defended. A minimal theoretical distance of 2.5 cm to the earlier settlers (corresponding to a density of 3.13 attacks dm(-2)) was calculated, but the attack density always remained lower, between 0.4 and 1.2 holes dm(-2), according to our observations.},

abstract = {A semi-physical fusion approach that uses the MODIS BRDF/Albedo land surface characterization product and Landsat ETM+ data to predict ETM+ reflectance on the same, an antecedent, or subsequent date is presented. The method may be used for ETM+ cloud/cloud shadow and SLC-off gap filling and for relative radiometric normalization. It is demonstrated over three study sites, one in Africa and two in the U.S. (Oregon and Idaho) that were selected to encompass a range of land cover land use types and temporal variations in solar illumination, land cover, land use, and phenology. Specifically, the 30 m ETM+ spectral reflectance is predicted for a desired date as the product of observed ETM+ reflectance and the ratio of the 500 m surface reflectance modeled using the MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters and the sun-sensor geometry on the predicted and observed Landsat dates. The difference between the predicted and observed ETM+ reflectance (prediction residual) is compared with the difference between the ETM+ reflectance observed on the two dates (temporal residual) and with respect to the MODIS BRDF model parameter quality. For all three scenes, and all but the shortest wavelength band, the mean prediction residual is smaller than the mean temporal residual, by up to a factor of three. The accuracy is typically higher at ETM+ pixel locations where the MODIS BRDF model parameters are derived using the best quality inversions. The method is most accurate for the ETM+ near-infrared (NIR) band; mean NIR prediction residuals are 9{\%}, 12{\%} and 14{\%} of the mean NIR scene reflectance of the African, Oregon and Idaho sites respectively. The developed fusion approach may be applied to any high spatial resolution satellite data, does not require any tuning parameters and so may be automated, is applied on a per-pixel basis and is unaffected by the presence of missing or contaminated neighboring Landsat pixels, accommodates for temporal variations due to surface changes (e.g., phenological, land cover/land use variations) observable at the 500 m MODIS BRDF/Albedo product resolution, and allows for future improvements through BRDF model refinement and error assessment. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the 'truth' of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements. Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot. The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

(Col.: Cleridae) and Rhizophagus depressus (F.) (Col.: Monotomidae) were monitored in 1995 in eight Scots pine stands in central Sweden using flight barrier traps (five per stand) baited with $\alpha$-pinene and ethanol. In four of the stands (A-stands) T. piniperda and associated species had reproduced the previous year in stumps and slash remaining after thinnings conducted in the winter of 1993/1994. In the remaining four stands (B-stands) no bark beetle breeding material had been available during the five preceding years. In addition, the flight periods of the species were monitored in one stand in 1996. In 1995 the catches of T. piniperda and R. depressus were four to five times higher in the A-stands than in the B-stands, whereas there was no difference in the catch of T. formicarius between the two kinds of stands. The T. formicarius/T. piniperda ratio was ca. 50 times higher in the B-stands compared with the A-stands during the period of clerid predation on colonising bark beetle adults and six times higher during the period of clerid oviposition. The R. depressus/T. piniperda ratio was only slightly higher in the A-strands than in the B-stands as a result of the spatial distribution of T, piniperda. Three additional species of bark beetle predators were caught: Glischrochilus quadripunctatus (L.), Pityophagus ferrugineus (F.) (Col.: Nitidulidae) and Rhizophagus ferrugineus (Payk.) (Col.: Monotomidae). Based on their seasonal abundance the bark beetle predators can be divided into three temporal groups: the first species to occur in the spring is G. quadripunctatus, the second group consists of R. depressus and T. formicarius, and the last species to initiate flight are R. ferrugineus and P ferrugineus.},

We quantified this considerable variability and analyzed whether recent disturbance episodes around the globe were consistently driven by climate, and if human influence modulates patterns of forest disturbance. We combined remote sensing data on recent (2001–2014) disturbances with in-depth local information for 50 protected landscapes and their surroundings across the temperate biome. Disturbance patterns are highly variable, and shaped by variation in disturbance agents and traits of prevailing tree species. However, high disturbance activity is consistently linked to warmer and drier than average conditions across the globe. Disturbances in protected areas are smaller and more complex in shape compared to their surroundings affected by human land use. This signal disappears in areas with high recent natural disturbance activity, underlining the potential of climate-mediated disturbance to transform forest landscapes.},

abstract = {1 High intraspecific competition is known to occur during Ips typographus outbreaks, and is thought to be the main factor regulating epidemic populations by affecting beetle population productivity. However, little is known about the consequences of intraspecific competition on population quality during outbreaks, although it could have consequences on beetle population dynamics. 2 Ips typographus morphological variations among localities, years and beetle population levels were investigated in 10 Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands having various beetle damage intensities. Beetle size and shape estimators based on wing length, and using isometric size and log-shape ratios, were employed. Field-caught beetles were compared with beetles emerging from controlled breeding at different densities, performed in the laboratory. Beetles from this colony were also used to check the influence of breeding densities on the size estimator. 3 Size variations occurred among localities and years and were consistent with the epidemic or latent status of the beetle populations. Controlled breeding confirmed the negative effect of beetle densities encountered in the field on offspring size. Two hypotheses are formulated to explain this increase of intraspecific competition during an outbreak, but our data support the effect of host quality change between latent and epidemic populations. 4 Shape variations also occurred among localities but were unrelated to beetle population levels. No groups consistent with a geographical structure were found, suggesting low genetic variation for I. typographus populations in France.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, many forest simulators have been developed for the forests of individual European countries. The underlying growth models are usually based on national datasets of varying size, obtained from National Forest Inventories or from long-term research plots. Many of these models include country- and location-specific predictors, such as site quality indices that may aggregate climate, soil properties and topography effects. Consequently, it is not sensible to compare such models among countries, and it is often impossible to apply models outside the region or country they were developed for. However, there is a clear need for more generically applicable but still locally accurate and climate sensitive simulators at the European scale, which requires the development of models that are applicable across the European continent. The purpose of this study is to develop tree diameter increment models that are applicable at the European scale, but still locally accurate. We compiled and used a dataset of diameter increment observations of over 2.3 million trees from 10 National Forest Inventories in Europe and a set of 99 potential explanatory variables covering forest structure, weather, climate, soil and nutrient deposition. Diameter increment models are presented for 20 species/species groups. Selection of explanatory variables was done using a combination of forward and backward selection methods. The explained variance ranged from 10{\%} to 53{\%} depending on the species. Variables related to forest structure (basal area of the stand and relative size of the tree) contributed most to the explained variance, but environmental variables were important to account for spatial patterns. The type of environmental variables included differed greatly among species. The presented diameter increment models are the first of their kind that are applicable at the European scale. This is an important step towards the development of a new generation of forest development simulators that can be applied at the European scale, but that are sensitive to variations in growing conditions and applicable to a wider range of management systems than before. This allows European scale but detailed analyses concerning topics like CO2 sequestration, wood mobilisation, long term impact of management, etc.},

The experiment was conducted in the second and third summers after the storm-felling. 5 Enemy impact was about twice as high in stands without wind-felled trees compared with in stands with wind-felled trees in the second summer whereas there was no significant difference between the stand types in the third summer. 6 The result demonstrates that spatial escape from enemies contributes to the rapid population growth of I. typographus after storm-disturbances.},

abstract = {There is a need for information on communication distances in natural systems and the ranges of action of synthetic pheromone traps. The differences between sampling range (RS, time dependent ecological measure) and attraction range (RA, behavioural measure) are stressed and compared to the simple but artificial effective attraction radius concept (REA, mainly trap and bait dependent). To estimate such ranges defined theoretical concepts and proper analysis of data are needed.Quantitative estimates are rare in the literature but maximum RA for Lepidoptera (moths) may reach 200–400 m and the corresponding RS functions may be in the range 200–500 m. RS estimated from regression of recapture of marked Cyclas formicarius (Curculionidae) after 16 h of sampling was 390 m for a high dose (10 $\mu$g) and 94 m for a low dose (0.01 $\mu$g). RA for bark beetles (Scolytidae) estimated from regression analysis of trap interactions are in the range of 19–97 m, but have large confidence intervals due to the few data points available. Passive traps at 1–35 m distance from pheromone traps yield RA values based on log-log regression values of between 17 and 34 m depending on pheromone release (10-5 to 10-2 g/h) for Ips typographus. Effective attraction radii's were estimated, both as simple point-estimates and as means with confidence intervals. Minima and maximum estimates obtained for bark beetles were 0.2-1 m for Tomicus piniperda, 0.6 m for T. minor, 0.3-3 m for Ips typographus, 3–10 m for Pityogenes chalcographus and 0.2-0.4 m for Scolytus (scolytus) triarmatus.It is concluded that RS and RA are of great basic and applied value but both difficult to estimate. REA lacks a direct relation to natural behaviour but is a useful index of trapping power and specificity.

abstract = {Defoliators and bark beetles are natural disturbance agents in many forest ecosystems around the world. Mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of insect disturbance dynamics can help in understanding their impacts on forest ecosystem resilience and functioning, and in developing adaptive management strategies. In recent years, much progress has been made in landscape-level analyses of insect-induced disturbances using remotely sensed data. However, many studies have focused on single insect agents or aggregated different insect agents into a single group. In this study, we characterized the temporal-spectral patterns associated with bark beetle and defoliator disturbances using Landsat time series between 1990 and 2013, with the objective to test if the two insect disturbances can be separated with Landsat data. We analyzed a recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura freemani Razowski) in British Columbia, Canada. To characterize the disturbance and recovery trends associated with insect disturbances we used the LandTrendr segmentation algorithm. We fitted LandTrendr spectral trajectories to annual normalized burn ratio (NBR) and Tasseled Cap (TC) time series, from which we then extracted a set of disturbance metrics. With these disturbance metrics, two random forest models were trained to a) distinguish insect disturbances from harvest and fire disturbances; and to b) attribute the insect disturbances to the most likely agent, i.e. mountain pine beetle or western spruce budworm. Insect disturbances were successfully mapped with an overall accuracy of 76.8{\%}, and agents were successfully attributed with overall accuracies ranging from 75.3{\%} to 88.0{\%}, depending on whether only pure host-stands or mixed stands with both insect hosts were considered. In the case of mixed host stands, nearly 45{\%} of the western spruce budworm disturbances were falsely attributed to mountain pine beetle. Spectral metrics describing disturbance magnitude were more important for distinguishing the two insect agents than the disturbance duration. Spectral changes associated with western spruce budworm disturbances had generally lower magnitudes than mountain pine beetle disturbances. Moreover, disturbances by western spruce budworm were more strongly associated with changes in TC greenness, whereas disturbances by mountain pine beetle were more strongly associated with changes in TC brightness and wetness. The results reflect the ephemeral nature of defoliators versus the tree mortality impacts of bark beetles in our study area. This study demonstrates the potential of Landsat time series for mapping bark beetle and defoliator disturbances at the agent level and highlights the need for distinguishing between the two insect agents to adequately capture their impacts on ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Bark beetles are powerful agents of change in dynamic forest ecosystems. Most assessments of the effects of bark beetle outbreaks have been based on negative impacts on timber production. The positive effects of bark beetle activities are much less well understood. Bark beetles perform vital functions at all levels of scale in forest ecosystems. At the landscape level they influence forest regeneration, and at the stand level they kill mature trees thus creating gaps and forest openings that are beneficial to wildlife. They also cause overall increases in forest and stand resiliency by promoting variability in sizes and ages of trees and in species compositions. The effects of bark beetles on forest ecosystems differ with beetle species, geographical location, host species, stand density and tree age. Whereas ecological consequences are normally beneficial to forest ecosystems, socioeconomic perceptions range from positive to negative. We provide several examples from western regions that illustrate ecological, economic, or social effects of bark beetle outbreaks.

abstract = {SC35 belongs to the family of SR proteins that regulate alternative splicing in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. We previously reported that SC35 is expressed through alternatively spliced mRNAs with differing 3' untranslated sequences and stabilities. Here, we show that overexpression of SC35 in HeLa cells results in a significant decrease of endogenous SC35 mRNA levels along with changes in the relative abundance of SC35 alternatively spliced mRNAs. Remarkably, SC35 leads to both an exon inclusion and an intron excision in the 3' untranslated region of its mRNAs. In vitro splicing experiments performed with recombinant SR proteins demonstrate that SC35, but not ASF/SF2 or 9G8, specifically activates these alternative splicing events. Interestingly, the resulting mRNA is very unstable and we present evidence that mRNA surveillance is likely to be involved in this instability. SC35 therefore constitutes the first example of a splicing factor that controls its own expression through activation of splicing events leading to expression of unstable mRNA.},

abstract = {Windstorms, bark beetle outbreaks and fires are important natural disturbances in coniferous forests worldwide. Wind-thrown trees promote biodiversity and restoration within production forests, but also cause large economic losses due to bark beetle infestation and accelerated fungal decomposition. Such damaged trees are often removed by salvage logging, which leads to decreased biodiversity and thus increasingly evokes discussions between economists and ecologists about appropriate strategies. To reveal the reasons behind species loss after salvage logging, we used a functional approach based on four habitat-related ecological traits and focused on saproxylic beetles. We predicted that salvage logging would decrease functional diversity (measured as effect sizes of mean pairwise distances using null models) as well as mean values of beetle body size, wood diameter niche and canopy cover niche, but would increase decay stage niche. As expected, salvage logging caused a decrease in species richness, but led to an increase in functional diversity by altering the species composition from habitat-filtered assemblages toward random assemblages. Even though salvage logging removes tree trunks, the most negative effects were found for small and heliophilous species and for species specialized on wood of small diameter. Our results suggested that salvage logging disrupts the natural assembly process on windthrown trees and that negative ecological impacts are caused more by microclimate alteration of the dead-wood objects than by loss of resource amount. These insights underline the power of functional approaches to detect ecosystem responses to anthropogenic disturbance and form a basis for management decisions in conservation. To mitigate negative effects on saproxylic beetle diversity after windthrows, we recommend preserving single windthrown trees or at least their tops with exposed branches during salvage logging. Such an extension of the green-tree retention approach to windthrown trees will preserve natural succession and associated communities of disturbed spruce forests.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the application and validation of the forest growth simulator SILVA 2.2 at the level of forest stands, forestry enterprises and large regions. The Design concept and structure of this distance-dependent and site-sensitive individual tree simulator have been presented in PRETZSCH (1992), KAHN (1994), KAHN and PRETZSCH (1997), PRETZSCH (2001). ne simulator owes its flexibility at stand level to the spatially explicit model approach and the parameter estimation, which is based on long-term experimental plots in pure and mixed stands. Some of the included time series date back to the year 1870. The simulator can be applied for Various purpose, and at different scales, and the results of the scenario calculations include estimated of timber yields as well as ecological and socio-economic indicators. In this paper, the development of a pure and mixed stand are compared by simulation at stand level, Thereafter, different silviculcural policies are investigated at enterprise level. The long-term consequences of forest management decisions at stand level become transparent once die growth projections are carried out at enterprise level. Thus, individual treatment regimes can be modified in order to achieve desired developments at enterprise level. Finally, the site-sensitive approach of SILVA 2.2, which is described in this paper, allows the analysis of the consequences of climate change. This is demonstrated in scenario calculations, which investigate the consequences of climate change on the growth and wood supply of spruce in Bavaria. The model validation was based on long-term experimental plots and showed a bias of -1.9{\%} to 4.8{\%}, an accuracy of 19.2{\%} to 38.6{\%} and a precision of 18.5{\%} to 38.6{\%} for the estimate of current stand volume increment. Similar results were obtained fur mean diameter increment and, furthermore, for individual tree level. In cast of short increment periods and extraordinary climatic conditions the values of bias and accuracy may prove less favourable In a qualitative comparison with inventory data the prediction behaviour of the site-growth model was proved to be fairly robust. Currently, however, the modelling of regional and temporal peculiarities such as nitrogen immissions or snow-break events has to be improved},

The classical maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) was first applied to classify Landsat-MSS of 1985 and Landsat-TM of 1995 and 2005. The major LULC identified were Woodland, Pasture/scrubland, Vineyard, Built-up and Water-body. By applying post-classification correction (PCC) using ancillary data and knowledge-based logic rules the overall classification accuracy was improved from about 72{\%} to 91{\%} for 1985 map, 76{\%} to 90{\%} for 1995 map and 79{\%} to 87{\%} for 2005 map. The improved overall Kappa statistics due to PCC were 0.88 for the 1985 map, 0.86 for 1995 and 0.83 for 2005. The PCC maps, assessed by McNemar's test, were found to have much higher accuracy in comparison to their counterpart MLC maps. The overall improvement in classification accuracy of the LULC maps is significant in terms of their potential use for land change modelling of the region.},

In the future, areas affected by bark beetles may further increase due to climate change. However, the early detection of the bark beetle green attack can guide management decisions to prevent larger damages. For this reason, a field-based bark beetle monitoring program is currently implemented in Germany. The combination of remote sensing and field data may help minimizing the reaction time and reducing costs of monitoring programs covering large forested areas. In this case study, RapidEye and TerraSAR-X data were analyzed separately and in combination to detect bark beetle green attack. The remote sensing data were acquired in May 2009 for a study site in south-west Germany. In order to distinguish healthy areas and areas affected by bark beetle green attack, three statistical approaches were compared: generalized linear models (GLM), maximum entropy (ME) and random forest (RF). The spatial scale (minimum mapping unit) was 78.5 m2. TerraSAR-X data resulted in fair classification accuracy with a cross-validated Cohen's Kappa Coefficient (kappa) of 0.23. RapidEye data resulted in moderate classification accuracy with a kappa of 0.51. The highest classification accuracy was obtained by combining the TerraSAR-X and RapidEye data, resulting in a kappa of 0.74. The accuracy of ME models was considerably higher than the accuracy of GLM and RF models.},

abstract = {Time series of images are required to extract and separate information on vegetation change due to phenological cycles, inter-annual climatic variability, and long-term trends. While images from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor have the spatial and spectral characteristics suited for mapping a range of vegetation structural and compositional properties, its 16-day revisit period combined with cloud cover problems and seasonally limited latitudinal range, limit the availability of images at intervals and durations suitable for time series analysis of vegetation in many parts of the world. Landsat Image Time Series (LITS) is defined here as a sequence of Landsat TM images with observations from every 16 days for a five-year period, commencing on July 2003, for a Eucalyptus woodland area in Queensland, Australia. Synthetic Landsat TM images were created using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) algorithm for all dates when images were either unavailable or too cloudy. This was done using cloud-free scenes and a MODIS Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) product. The ability of the LITS to measure attributes of vegetation phenology was examined by: (1) assessing the accuracy of predicted image-derived Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) estimates using ground-measured values; and (2) comparing the LITS-generated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1) time series. The predicted image-derived FPC products (value ranges from 0 to 100{\%}) had an RMSE of 5.6. Comparison between vegetation phenology parameters estimated from LITS-generated NDVI and MODIS NDVI showed no significant difference in trend and less than 16 days (equal to the composite period of the MODIS data used) difference in key seasonal parameters, including start and end of season in most of the cases. In comparison to similar published work, this paper tested the STARFM algorithm in a new (broadleaf) forest environment and also demonstrated that the approach can be used to form a time series of Landsat TM images to study vegetation phenology over a number of years.},

abstract = {Tree mortality caused by bark beetle infestation has significant effects on the ecology and value of both natural and commercial forests. Therefore, prediction of bark beetle infestations is critical in forest management. Existing predictive models, however, rarely consider the influence of long-term stressors on forest susceptibility to bark beetle infestation. In this study we introduce pre-disturbance spectral trajectories from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery as an indicator of long-term stress into models of bark beetle infestation together with commonly used environmental predictors. Observations for this study come from forests in the central part of the {\v{S}}umava Mountains, in the border region between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The areas of bark beetle-infested forest were delineated from aerial photographs taken in 1991 and in every year from 1994 to 2000. The environmental predictors represent forest stand attributes (e.g., tree density and distance to the infested forest from previous year) and common abiotic factors, such as topography, climate, geology, and soil. Pre-disturbance spectral trajectories were defined by the linear regression slope of Tasseled Cap components (Wetness, Brightness and Greenness) calculated from a time series of 16 Landsat TM images across years from 1984 until one year before the bark beetle infestation. Using logistic regression and multimodel inference, we calculated predictive models separately for each single year from 1994 to 2000 to account for a possible shift in importance of individual predictors during disturbance. Inclusion of two pre-disturbance spectral trajectories (Wetness slope and Brightness slope) significantly improved predictive ability of bark beetle infestation models. Wetness slope had the greatest predictive power, even relative to environmental predictors, and was relatively stable in its power over the years. Brightness slope improved the model only in the middle of the disturbance period (1996). Importantly, these pre-disturbance predictors were not correlated with other predictors, and therefore bring additional explanatory power to the model. Generally, the predictive power of most fitted model decreases as time progresses and models describing the initial phase of bark beetle outbreaks appear more reliable for conducting near-future predictions. The pre-disturbance spectral trajectories are valuable not only for assessing the risk of bark beetle infestation, but also for detection of long-term gradual changes even in non-forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Although a large number of new image classification algorithms have been developed, they are rarely tested with the same classification task. In this research, with the same Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data set and the same classification scheme over Guangzhou City, China, we tested two unsupervised and 13 supervised classification algorithms, including a number of machine learning algorithms that became popular in remote sensing during the past 20 years. Our analysis focused primarily on the spectral information provided by the TM data. We assessed all algorithms in a per-pixel classification decision experiment and all supervised algorithms in a segment-based experiment. We found that when sufficiently representative training samples were used, most algorithms performed reasonably well. Lack of training samples led to greater classification accuracy discrepancies than classification algorithms themselves. Some algorithms were more tolerable to insufficient (less representative) training samples than others. Many algorithms improved the overall accuracy marginally with per-segment decision making.},

abstract = {Field research was conducted to determine the potential of hyperspectral and multispectral imagery for late-season discrimination and mapping of grass weed infestations in wheat. Differences in reflectance between weed-free wheat and wild oat, canarygrass, and ryegrass were statistically significant in most 25-nm-wide wavebands in the 400- and 900-nm spectrum, mainly due to their differential maturation. Visible (blue, B; green, G; red, R) and near infrared (NIR) wavebands and five vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), R/B, NIR-R and (R − G)/(R + G), showed potential for discriminating grass weeds and wheat. The efficiency of these wavebands and indices were studied by using color and color-infrared aerial images taken over three naturally infested fields. In StaCruz, areas infested with wild oat and canarygrass patches were discriminated using the indices R, NIR, and NDVI with overall accuracies (OA) of 0.85 to 0.90. In Florida–West, areas infested with wild oat, canarygrass, and ryegrass were discriminated with OA from 0.85 to 0.89. In Florida–East, for the discrimination of the areas infested with wild oat patches, visible wavebands and several vegetation indices provided OA of 0.87 to 0.96. Estimated grass weed area ranged from 56 to 71{\%}, 43 to 47{\%}, and 69 to 80{\%} of the field in the three locations, respectively, with per-class accuracies from 0.87 to 0.94. NDVI was the most efficient vegetation index, with a highly accurate performance in all locations. Our results suggest that mapping grass weed patches in wheat is feasible with high-resolution satellite imagery or aerial photography acquired 2 to 3 wk before crop senescence.},

abstract = {The development of methods that can accurately detect physiological stress in forest trees caused by biotic or abiotic factors is vital for ensuring productive forest systems that can meet the demands of the Earth's population. The emergence of new sensors and platforms presents opportunities to augment traditional practices by combining remotely-sensed data products to provide enhanced information on forest condition. We tested the sensitivity of multispectral imagery collected from time-series unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite imagery to detect herbicide-induced stress in a carefully controlled experiment carried out in a mature Pinus radiata D. Don plantation. The results revealed that both data sources were sensitive to physiological stress in the study trees. The UAV data were more sensitive to changes at a finer spatial resolution and could detect stress down to the level of individual trees. The satellite data tested could only detect physiological stress in clusters of four or more trees. Resampling the UAV imagery to the same spatial resolution as the satellite imagery revealed that the differences in sensitivity were not solely the result of spatial resolution. Instead, vegetation indices suited to the sensor characteristics of each platform were required to optimise the detection of physiological stress from each data source. Our results define both the spatial detection threshold and the optimum vegetation indices required to implement monitoring of this forest type. A comparison between time-series datasets of different spectral indices showed that the two sensors are compatible and can be used to deliver an enhanced method for monitoring physiological stress in forest trees at various scales. We found that the higher resolution UAV imagery was more sensitive to fine-scale instances of herbicide induced physiological stress than the RapidEye imagery. Although less sensitive to smaller phenomena the satellite imagery was found to be very useful for observing trends in physiological stress over larger areas.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. The Eurasian spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (IT), is considered the most destructive insect pest of spruce forests in the Palaearctic region. Its control is based on a range of phytosanitary measures, insecticide treatments targeting the tree trunks, and pheromone trappings. Essential oils (EOs) from aromatic plants have been recognized as ecological alternatives to synthetic pesticides. In this study, EOs from plants in the Lamiaceae family (Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris, Hyssopus officinalis and Mentha × piperita) and the Apiaceae family (Pimpinella anisum and Foeniculum vulgare) were studied for insecticidal and repellent effects against IT. EOs chemical composition was analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry. IT adults were exposed to different concentrations of EOs, and their effects were recorded 2–96 h post-treatment. Significant differences in biological activity were observed, and the greatest insecticidal effect was detected for O. vulgare, T. vulgaris, and P. anisum; but O. vulgare EO was significantly more toxic at all doses or exposure times. Repellency index (RI) varied among the EOs and depended on dose and exposure time. At doses of 0.077‒0.219 µl/cm2, the RI increased until 4‒6 h post-treatment; after that period, it decreased. Pimpinella anisum, O. vulgare, and T. vulgaris EOs showed significantly higher repellent effects compared to F. vulgare and H. officinalis EOs. Mentha × piperita EOs exhibited neither repellent nor insecticidal activity against IT. To our knowledge, this is the first time that EOs biological activity against IT was studied.},

The catches were highest near the middle of the transects and lower at both ends of them. 4 This pattern was associated, on the one hand, with an urbanization gradient with the numbers of flying individuals increasing with the distance from the city centre and, on the other hand, with lower catches at the periphery of the city where a high proportion of broadleaved trees may have disrupted the response to aggregation pheromones. 5 In addition to the probable rural origin of the beetles, high catches at the Port of Brussels indicated that some of the insects might be of foreign origin and enter the city with imported timber, highlighting a pathway for unintentional introductions of organisms, including potentially invasive species.},

In the following spring of 2014, a survey recording the occurrence of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) was initiated in order to describe the dynamics of beetle reproduction in relation to protection measures executed in wind-damaged stands. Ten research plots with 20 trees each were established in a socalled active protection zone, where the broken and fallen trees had been processed and removed in 2014, and in a passive protection zone, where no actions were taken, and the dynamics of Norway spruce mortality due to bark beetle infestation including quantitative parameters (infestation density, sex ratio of beetle populations) were examined. The entomological analyses were performed on 25 × 25 cm large bark samples taken from four (active zone) or two (passive zone) tree sections. In the first year of the survey, no infested standing trees were recorded on the plots and the colonisation of fallen and broken trees was very weak. In the second year (2015), infestations appeared in larger numbers on the plots with passive compared to active protection but the infestation density was 0.89 mating chambers per 1 dm2 regardless of the protection status. In the third year (2016), most of the remaining living spruces had been infested with a mean density of 0.82 m.ch. per 1 dm2. In 2015, the proportion of females in the beetle population was 65.8{\%} being higher in the active (68.4{\%}) than the passive (64.0{\%}) protection zone, while in 2016 the proportion was 63.5{\%} and in this case slightly higher in the passive protection zone (63.9{\%} as compared to 63.2{\%}). These results are in accordance with patterns observed in wind-damaged Norway spruce stands of other areas in Poland and Europe and demonstrate the usefulness of forest management procedures in mitigating I. typographus outbreaks.},

abstract = {Detailed analyses of thresholded ecological interactions call improve Our understanding of the transition from aperiodic to periodic dynamics. We develop a threshold model of the population dynamics of outbreaking bark beetle populations that alternate between non-epidemic and epidemic behavior. The model involves accumulation of resources during low-density periods and depletion during outbreaks. The transition between the two regimes is caused by disturbance events in the form of major tree felling by wind. The model is analyzed with particular reference to the population dynamics of the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) in Scandinavia for which a comprehensive literature allows full parameterization, The fairly constant outbreak lengths and the highly variable waiting time between Outbreaks that are-seen in the historical records of this species agree well with the predictions of the model. The thresholded resource-depletion dynamics result in substantial variation in the degree of periodicity between stochastic realizations. The completely aperiodic tree colonizations are partly predictable when the timing of the irregular windfall events are known. However, the predictability of inter-outbreak periods is low due to the large variation of cases falling most frequently in the middle between the extremes of purely nonperiodic (erratic) and periodic (Cyclic) fluctuations.},

abstract = {The major bark beetle threat to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in Eurasia is the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. Beetles cause damage after population build-up in defenseless trees. To minimize attacks, timely removal of these trees is important. This is practiced by clearing of wind throws and sanitation felling. Thus, knowledge about the region-specific flight pattern and voltinism of I. typographus is necessary for efficient pest management. This thesis focuses on the flight initiation and the variation in flight pattern of I. typographus over the season, which we have studied using pheromone traps during a seven year period in Sweden. Additionally, logs, that became colonized, were used to determine thermal sums required for the re-emergence of parental beetles and the emergence of filial beetles in southern Sweden. Swarming began in the end of April (51 degree-days (dd) {\textgreater}5°C; daytime temp. {\textgreater}18°C). More than 50{\%} of the flight activity occurred after mid-June and it continued until mid-August. That is a longer flight period than has been recorded previously. At least partly, this discrepancy with previous observations may be explained by our results that the temperature requirement for flight commencement is fulfilled more than two weeks earlier now than 30 years ago. Re-emergence of parental beetles from the first brood started in the end of May (122 dd {\textgreater}5°C). A much higher proportion of parental beetles had re-emerged from trees colonized in May (95{\%}) compared to in June (60{\%}) or July (20{\%}). This verifies that sister broods is an important part of the beetles' reproductive biology. The high proportion of beetles that re-emerged together with a significant continued beetle flight and oviposition showed that a high proportion of the beetles initate at least one sister brood. Filial beetles began to emerge in the end of June (437 dd {\textgreater}5°C) and were caught in flight traps in early July and at least a partial second generation was started in each year. A much higher proportion of filial beetles had emerged from trees colonized in May (75{\%}) than in June (50{\%}) and July (15{\%}). We have shown that the temperature requirement for flight initiation are met earlier in the present climate which gives more time for the development of several sister broods and a potential second generation. This together with an expected increase in severe storm fellings indicates that the need for efficient pest management will increase with time. Timely removal of wind-felled trees is the main pest management option and in this thesis I present results of when the critical time periods occurs.},

Because only a few pathogens are known for Trypodendron species, the aim of this work was to determine the spectrum of pathogen species of T. lineatum , T. laeve , and T. domesticum . Trypodendron species were collected in pheromone traps at nine localities in the Czech Republic, five localities in Poland, and one locality in Austria. In total, 2,439 T. lineatum , 171 T. domesticum , and 17 T. laeve beetles were dissected and examined. Infection was found in only two of the 17 specimens of T. laeve and in only two of the 171 specimens of T. domesticum ; in all four cases, the parasites were nematodes. Parasitisation of T. lineatum by nematodes was found in T. lineatum at eight localities with a mean ( ± SE) parasitisation level of 8.1 ± 4.7{\%}. A Chytridiopsis sp. was detected in cells of the midgut epithelium of one T. lineatum specimen, and Gregarina sp. was detected in the midgut lumen of two T. lineatum specimens; no other pathogens were found in T. lineatum . The low infection rates and the tendency for infection by nematodes can be explained by the monogamy of Trypodendron spp. and their feeding on fungi in short galleries that are not connected to the galleries of conspecifics. },

abstract = {The two storms Vivian (1990) and Lothar (1999) left an area of roughly 9000 ha of fully damaged protection forests in Swiss mountain regions. Given this huge dimension, questions arose on how to manage these areas to keep the protection gap, i.e. the time period with reduced overall protection against natural hazards, short. Quantifications are presented for the stability of lying logs left in place, the frequency of post-disturbance mass movements, and the tree regeneration in windthrow areas. The average height above ground of unsalvaged lying logs decreased from 2.1 m shortly after disturbance to 0.8 m 20 years later. In the period 1990–2014, the number of avalanches in windthrow areas was markedly small, and annual rates of shallow landslides and debris flows in windthrow areas did not differ from rates in comparable undamaged forested areas. Regeneration density rarely exceeded 4000 stems ha-1 20 years postwindthrow at elevations above 1200–1500 m a.s.l. Mean height of tallest trees reached 5.6 m in areas that were cleared and 6.5 m in those left unsalvaged. Trees planted postwindthrow were 1.0–2.4 m taller than naturally regenerated ones. Practitioners rated the protective effect to be acceptable 24 years post-disturbance in only 5 out from 16 observed windthrow areas (31{\%}), with planting trees as the main cause of success. We conclude that in protection forests the regeneration speed after disturbance rarely meets practitioner's expectations in terms of both stem density and stand structure. However, leaving woody debris from wind disturbance in place proved to replace protective effects for an astonishingly long time. An intensive management with salvage logging, planting and even technical constructions seems therefore only inevitable on windthrown areas where risks seem too high based on hazard, damage potential and possible spread of bark beetles to nearby protection forests. A management alternative applicable to many other cases of windthrown protection forests is to plant trees between lying stems},

abstract = {Forested hillslopes form a special geoecosystem, an environment of geomorphic processes that depend strongly on forest ecology, including the growth and decay of trees, changes in structure, disturbances and other fluctuations. Hence, the following various functions of trees are reviewed here: their role in both biomechanical and biochemical weathering, as well as their importance for the hillslope geomorphic subsystem and for transport of soil material via tree uprooting and root growth. Special attention is paid to tree uprooting, a process considered the most efficient and most frequent biogeomorphological indicator of bio-physical activity within forest in complex terrain. Trees have varied implications for soil formation in different environments (boreal to tropical forests) and altitudes. In this paper an attempt has been made to emphasize how trees not only modulate geomorphic processes, but also how they act as a direct or indirect agent of microrelief formation, the most striking example of which being widespread and long-lasting pit-and-mound microtopography. Based on the analyzed literature it seems that some problems attributed to forest ecology can have a fundamental effect on forested hillslope dynamics, a relationship which points to the need for its integration and interpretation within the field of geomorphology. The biology of individual trees has a key influence on the development of e.g. rock faces, weathering front migration and changes in the soil biomantle within upper and lower forest belts. Additionally, forms and sediments depend largely on the horizontal and vertical extent, volume and structure of root systems, as well as on active processes taking place in the root zone and rhizosphere. Furthermore, although trees to a large extent stabilize slope surfaces, their presence can also have a dual effect on slope stability due to tree uprooting, a process which in some circumstances can trigger mass movements (e.g. debris avalanches). So far, several attempts at quantifying the influence of trees on slopes have been made via the use of mathematical equations, enabling researchers to calculate: 1) the root plate volume of uprooted trees, 2) the amount of soil displacement due to tree root growth, and 3) rates of erosion, sedimentation and soil creep. In light of the reviewed literature, the most urgent issue appears to be the need for a thorough study of the interactions and feedbacks occurring between trees and geomorphic systems (e.g. soil mixing and biotransport by trees) in different climate zones, altitudes and time frames, especially in terms of the development of forest ecosystems during the Holocene. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To maintain biodiversity in forests more wind-felled trees must be left. However, there is concern among forest owners that this may result in higher tree mortality caused by the spruce bark beetle (SBB). Data from six studies on number of trees killed by the SBB in storm-disturbed stands was analysed. The studies include 16 areas, 2–346 ha in size, where wind-felled spruce trees were left. In one of the studies also stands where all wind-felled trees were removed directly after the storm were included. Few trees were killed in the first summer following the storm disturbance. In most stands the tree mortality peaked already in the second or third summer following the storm. But in five of the stands tree mortality peaked later. The number of trees killed per ha by the SBB varies much between the studied stands. There was a trend that the larger areas experienced on average higher tree mortality per ha than the smaller areas. One of the studies, including six stands, demonstrated an almost perfect correlation between the number of colonised wind-felled trees and the number of killed trees in a 4-year period following the storm disturbance. In the same study the removal of wind-felled trees resulted in a 50{\%} reduction in number of trees killed per ha in the 4-years following the storm.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology {\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society The boreal biome, representing approximately one-third of remaining global forests, provides a number of crucial ecosystem services. A particular challenge in forest ecosystems is to reconcile demand for an increased timber production with provisioning of other ecosystem services and biodiversity. However, there is still little knowledge about how forest management could help solve this challenge. Hence, studies that investigate how to manage forests to reduce trade-offs between ecosystem services and biodiversity are urgently needed to help forest owners and policy makers take informed decisions. We applied seven alternative forest management regimes using a forest growth simulator in a large boreal forest production landscape. First, we estimated the potential of the landscape to provide harvest revenues, store carbon and maintain biodiversity across a 50-year time period. Then, we applied multiobjective optimization to identify the trade-offs between these three objectives and to identify the optimal combination of forest management regimes to achieve these objectives. It was not possible to achieve high levels of either carbon storage or biodiversity if the objective of forest management was to maximize timber harvest revenues. Moreover, conflicts between biodiversity and carbon storage became stronger when simultaneously targeting high levels of timber revenues. However, with small reductions in timber revenues, it was possible to greatly increase the multifunctionality of the landscape, especially the biodiversity indicators. Forest management actions, alternative to business-as-usual management, such as reducing thinnings, extending the rotation period and increasing the amount of area set aside from forestry may be necessary to safeguard biodiversity and non-timber ecosystem services in Fennoscandia. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that no forest management regime alone is able to maximize timber revenues, carbon storage and biodiversity individually or simultaneously and that a combination of different regimes is needed to resolve the conflicts among these objectives. We conclude that it is possible to reduce the trade-offs between different objectives by applying diversified forest management planning at the boreal landscape level and that we need to give up the all-encompassing objective of very intensive timber production, which is prevailing particularly in Fennoscandian countries.},

abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns onHydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

abstract = {The role of public-private partnerships as an innovative mode of enhancing the quality of government functioning has been steadily increasing over the last decade. This process is visible across the world, and the specific governance context has varied widely. What is quite remarkable is the tremendous variety of innovative organizational forms that these partnerships have come to embody. Authoritative surveys of evidence available concerning these public-private partnerships have concluded that easy generalizations about their optimal institutional design are not possible at this stage of our knowledge (Boston, 2000). Consequently, it is important to examine closely the organizational and strategic design characteristics of promising and successful ongoing public-private partnership innovations. This paper analyzes one such case, which relates to an important process reform at the level of the urban local government—that of the attempted institutionalization of a new, transparent method of assessment and collection of urban property taxes by the Bangalore City Corporation.1 This is the Self-Assessment Scheme (SAS), which was introduced in April, 2000. At a micro-level, the innovation is one of fiscal process reform at the level of an urban local body. The innovation is in line with the broad national (and international) agenda of fiscal reform, involving simplification and rationalization. It is also in tune with current trends in governance reform since it embodies such principles as transparency, citizen-friendliness and the curbing of corruption. However, the process reform must be understood in its larger social and economic context, which is that of a city in a developing country (with its multiple stakeholders) responding to an emergent challenge brought about by rapid change. The nature of this overall response embodies a particular type of public-private partnership that has, in our view, been important in the success that this initiative has so far attained. The case illustrates the role that public-private partnership can play in the institutionalization of a process innovation. The paper is structured as follows. We begin by explaining the salient features of the overall social and economic context in which this experiment is being attempted. We seek to explain the precise nature of the public-private partnership that is a key element of this innovation. Next, we present a detailed account of the implementation process of SAS. Finally, we present the lessons that we draw from this case, based on our assessment of the success factors and weaknesses of this partnership innovation.},

abstract = {The island of Madagascar has a unique biodiversity, mainly located in the tropical forests of the island. This biodiversity is highly threatened by anthropogenic deforestation. Existing historical forest maps at national level are scattered and have substantial gaps which prevent an exhaustive assessment of long-term deforestation trends in Madagascar. In this study, we combined historical national forest cover maps (covering the period 1953–2000) with a recent global annual tree cover loss dataset (2001–2014) to look at six decades of deforestation and forest fragmentation in Madagascar (from 1953 to 2014). We produced new forest cover maps at 30 m resolution for the year 1990 and annually from 2000 to 2014 over the full territory of Madagascar. We estimated that Madagascar has lost 44{\%} of its natural forest cover over the period 1953–2014 (including 37{\%} over the period 1973–2014). Natural forests cover 8.9 Mha in 2014 (15{\%} of the national territory) and include 4.4 Mha (50{\%}) of moist forests, 2.6 Mha (29{\%}) of dry forests, 1.7 Mha of spiny forests (19{\%}) and 177 000 ha (2{\%}) of mangroves. Since 2005, the annual deforestation rate has progressively increased in Madagascar to reach 99 000 ha/yr during 2010–2014 (corresponding to a rate of 1.1{\%}/yr). Around half of the forest (46{\%}) is now located at less than 100 m from the forest edge. Our approach could be replicated to other developing countries with tropical forest. Accurate forest cover change maps can be used to assess the effectiveness of past and current conservation programs and implement new strategies for the future. In particular, forest maps and estimates can be used in the REDD+ framework which aims at “Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation” and for optimizing the current protected area network.},

@article{Daniel2012,
abstract = {This paper outlines how state-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) can be used to project changes in vegetation over time across a landscape. STSMs are stochastic, empirical simulation models that use an adapted Markov chain approach to predict how vegetation will transition between states over time, typically in response to interactions between succession, disturbances and management. With STSMs a landscape is divided into a set of simulation cells, each cell is assigned to an initial vegetation state, and the model then predicts how each cell may change from one vegetation state to another over time. Over the years an extensive suite of features have been added to STSMs that allow them to represent a range of dynamics important to landscape modeling, including tracking age-structure, triggering transitions based on past events, setting targets for certain transitions, and varying transition rates over time. STSMs are also now able to represent spatial variability in two different ways: by dividing the landscape into spatial strata, typically defined by one or more important drivers of vegetation change, or alternatively by developing a spatially-explicit STSM, whereby transition events, such as fire or invasion by non-native vegetation, can be simulated to spread across the landscape. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, STSMs have been applied to a wide range of landscapes and management questions, including forests, rangelands, grasslands, wetlands and aquatic communities, over spatial extents ranging from thousands to millions of hectares. Several software tools currently exist to support the development of STSMs; the most recent of these products, called the Path Landscape Model, is the latest in a lineage of STSM development tools that includes both the Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT) and the Tool for Exploratory Landscape Analysis (TELSA).},

abstract = {The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scan line corrector (SLC) failed on May 31, 2003, causing the scanning pattern to exhibit wedge-shaped scan-to-scan gaps. The ETM+ has continued to acquire data with the SLC powered off, leading to images that are missing approximately 22 percent of the normal scene area. To improve the utility of the SLC-off data, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed new products that use the data from multiple ETM+ scenes to provide complete ground coverage. These gap-filled products were developed and deployed in two phases. The gaps in the Phase I products are filled with data from imagery collected previously with a functional SLC (SLC-on). A single SLC-on scene provides complete coverage of the scan gaps, making the gap-filling procedure straightforward. Several radiometric adjustment techniques for matching the SLC-on fill scene to the SLC-off primary scene were evaluated for performance, processing speed, and ease of implementation. A simple local histogram matching method was adopted as a result of this evaluation. The Phase II products use data from multiple SLC-off scenes to fill the scan gaps with more recent data. Because the locations of the scan gaps are different for each SLC-off scene, the gap-filling process must account for scan gap interactions. The Phase II product development included a more comprehensive study of candidate radiometric adjustment techniques. This study showed that the histogram matching method used in Phase I, with minor refinements, provided the best overall performance and was adopted for Phase II as well.},

We used the forest landscape and disturbance model iLand to quantify (i) the recovery times of the total ecosystem C, (ii) the effect of climate change on C recovery, and (iii) the differential factors contributing to C recovery. We reconstructed a recent disturbance episode (2008–2016) based on Landsat satellite imagery, which affected 39{\%} of the forest area in the 16,000 ha study landscape. We subsequently simulated forest recovery under a continuation of business-as-usual management until 2100. Our results indicated that the recovery of the pre-disturbance C stocks (C payback time) was reached 17 years after the end of the disturbance episode. The C stocks of a theoretical undisturbed development trajectory were reached 30 years after the disturbance episode (C sequestration parity). Drier and warmer climates delayed simulated C recovery. Without the fertilizing effect of CO2, C payback times were delayed by 5–9 years, while C parity was not reached within the 21st century. Recovery was accelerated by an enhanced C uptake compared to undisturbed conditions (disturbance legacy sink effect) that persisted for 35 years after the disturbance episode. Future climate could have negative impacts on forest recovery and thus further amplify climate change through C loss from ecosystems, but the effect is strongly contingent on the magnitude and persistence of alleviating CO2effects. Our modelling study highlights the need to consider both negative and positive effects of disturbance (i.e., C loss immediately after an event vs. enhanced C uptake of the recovering forest) in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of disturbance effects on the forest C cycle.},

abstract = {1. It has recently been suggested that expected increases in temperature might lead to an additional generation per season in bark beetles. Thus, populations would grow more rapidly. However, an additional but not fully developed generation could lead to high winter mortality in the pre-imaginal stages. 2. Winter survivability and post-diapause fitness as a function of the overwintering developmental stage of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus L. were studied along an altitudinal cline. Fitness was tested in terms of weight, lipid content and flight capacity. 3. Mortality was significantly lower and emergence per brood system significantly higher for fully developed adults that entered overwintering than for larvae, pupae or callow adults. 4. Post-diapause fitness in terms of dry weight and flight capacity was significantly higher in individuals that completed development before winter, and lipid contents also showed a trend for being higher in those individuals. 5. In conclusion, in a scenario where effective temperature sums are not adequate for the complete development of an additional generation, models may overestimate population growth by neglecting increased mortality and reduced post-diapause fitness. The results highlight the importance of considering life-history traits and indirect effects in addition to abiotic factors such as temperature when modelling population dynamics.},

abstract = {We used the European Forest Information Scenario Model (EFISCEN) to project the development of forest resources for 15 European countries from 2000 to 2100 under a broad range of climate scenarios, which were based on the a1fi, a2, b1 and b2 storylines of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Each climate scenario was associated with consistent land-use change and wood demand assumptions. Climate change-induced growth changes were incorporated into the calculations by scaling inventory-based stem growth in EFISCEN by net primary productivity estimated from the Lund–Potsdam–Jena dynamic global vegetation model. The impact of changes in wood demand, climate and forest area were studied separately, and in combination, in order to assess their respective effects. For all climate scenarios under consideration, climate change resulted in increased forest growth, especially in Northern Europe. In Southern Europe, higher precipitation in spring and the projected increased water-use efficiency in response to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations mitigated the effects of increasing summer drought. Climate change enhanced carbon sequestration in tree biomass. The climate change-induced increase in tree growth led to a faster increase in growing stocks compared with the simulation using current climate. As productivity decreased in higher stocked forests, the positive impact of climate change began to level off during the second half of the 21st century in the scenarios where wood demand was low. Afforestation measures had the potential to increase growing stock and annual increment; however, large areas were needed to obtain notable effects. Despite noticeable differences in the growth response between the climate scenarios, changes in wood demand proved to be the crucial driving force in forest resource development. Tree carbon stocks increased by 33–114{\%} between 2000 and 2100 when only changes in wood demand were regarded. Climate change added another 23–31{\%} increase, while changes in forest area accounted for an additional increase of 2–40{\%}. Our results highlight potential future pathways of forest resource development resulting from different scenarios of wood demand, land use and climate changes, and stress the importance of resource utilization in the European forest carbon balance.},

abstract = {The conventional theory of boreal forest dynamics recognizes two distinct disturbance regime types, small-scale gap dynamics and dynamics driven by large stand-replacing disturbances. We used satellite imagery and extensive field measurements to examine the landscape-level pattern and impact of an extensive disturbance episode that occurred in the early 2000s in primeval forest dominated by Picea abies in the Arkhangelsk region, Russia, due to drought and subsequent bark beetle (Ips typographus) outbreak. We also quantified forest age structures and deadwood characteristics at the landscape-level to study how such disturbances shape forest structures over larger scales. Satellite image analysis revealed that disturbance patches covered about 16{\%} of the land area in the 12. km. ×. 12. km landscape studied. The size of the disturbance patches was strongly skewed toward small ones (median size 0.12. ha) and they were distributed across the landscape with some tendency of aggregation. The landscape forest matrix was dominated by old-growth forest. The dominant trees in the forest were established prior to 1850, and approximately half of the forest had established prior to 1800. However, the patchy occurrence of younger forest suggests that the landscape previously was subject to patchy disturbance similar to the recent one. This conclusion also gained support from historical records. We conclude that the structure and dynamics of the studied primeval forest landscape was driven by the combined impact of small-scale "background" mortality (classical gap dynamics) and infrequent episodes of patchy intermediate severity and scale disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is the most damaging pest of mature pine (Pinaceae) in western North America. Although mountain pine beetles have an obligate dispersal phase during which adults must locate a new host for brood production, dispersal is a poorly understood aspect of its ecology. This flight mill study was designed to test the effects of beetle size, sex, and age on flight capacity. Energy use during flight was assessed through measurements of weight before and after flight and fat content of flown versus control beetles. The mean flight distance achieved by mountain pine beetles varied between 2.12 and 5.95 km over the 23-h bioassay, but the longest total flight of an individual beetle was {\textgreater}24 km. Beetle preflight weight influenced flight initiation, flight distance, and duration. Bigger beetles are more likely to fly and once in flight fly longer and farther than smaller beetles. There was no direct effect of beetle sex on flight capacity. Flight capacity of beetles declined with age postemergence. Although individual flight capacity was variable, flight velocity was relatively constant between 1.55 and 1.93 km/h. Lipids are used to power flight in mountain pine beetles, as lipid content was lower in beetles flown on the flight mills compared with beetles that did not fly. Flight distance was negatively correlated with beetle postflight lipid content. The baseline flight capacity data revealed in this study have implications for understanding the population dynamics of this eruptive forest pest.},

abstract = {The spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus , is one of the most extensively studied European forest pests. Gaps exist in the knowledge about second generation breeding performance in bivoltine populations. In this study, the breeding performance of the second generation was evaluated in three bivoltine populations of I. typographus in the SE Alps. Length of the maternal galleries (from 40.5 to 44.8 mm), population growth rate (PGR; from 0.7 to 3.6), and emerged adults per m 2 (from 669 to 1,570 insects/m 2 ) varied among populations and were negatively correlated with bark colonisation density. Pheromone traps set up in the three investigated forests differed in the number of trapped beetles, with mean captures ranging between 5,310 and 19,850 insects per trap. The populations giving the highest captures in the traps showed the lowest bark colonisation density (248 vs. 489 maternal galleries per m 2 ) and the best breeding performance. The populations of parasitoids and predators corresponded to just 1–9 and 2–10{\%} of the emerging I. typographus adults, respectively, and phloem temperature never reached thresholds lethal to I. typographus . Interspecific competition was negligible, whereas intraspecific competition was found to be the main factor affecting the breeding performance of the second generation, although with different intensity according to the colonisation density. It is hypothesised that competition with the first generation and spring precipitation influence the number of suitable hosts available to the second generation.},

SAR data due to its high spatial resolution and its capability of all weather conditions makes a proper choice for tropical countries. Texture is considered as an effective factor in distinguishing the classes especially in SAR imagery which records the backscatters that carry information of kind, direction, heterogeneity and relationship of the features. This paper put forward a computer program for texture analysis for high resolution radar data. Texture analysis program is introduced and discussed using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). To demonstrate the ability and correctness of this program, a test subset of TerraSAR-X imagery from Terengganu area, Malaysia was analyzed and pixel-based and object-based classification were attempted. The thematic maps derived by pixel-based method could not achieve acceptable visual interpretation and for that reason no accuracy assessment was performed on them. The overall accuracy achieved by object-based method was 83.63{\%} with kappa coefficient of 0.8. Results on image texture classification showed that the proposed program is capable for texture analysis in TerraSAR-X image and the obtained textural analysis resulted in high classification accuracy. The proposed texture analysis program can be used in many applications such as land use/cover (LULC) mapping, hazard studies and many other applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The decline of many saproxylic species results from the decrease in old-growth structures in European harvested forests. Among conservation tools, protected reserves withdrawn from regular harvesting and extended rotations have been employed to restore old-growth attributes in structurally simplified managed forests, even if the effects of such management actions on forest habitats and biodiversity remain largely unknown. In this study, we compared structural stand features and saproxylic beetle assemblages in two stand classes - recently harvested stands and long-established reserves, where less or more than 30 years had elapsed since last harvest. Habitat and saproxylic beetle data were collected according to standardized protocols in 153 plots in seven lowland deciduous forests. Tangible contrasts in stand features were found between long-established reserves and recently harvested plots. Indeed, most higher-value densities and volumes were found in unharvested areas. The difference was weaker for microhabitat-bearing tree density than for deadwood; some deadwood features, such as volume of large downed and standing deadwood showed a very pronounced difference, thus indicating a marked deleterious effect of forest harvesting on these elements. Deadwood diversity, on the other hand, was only slightly affected and the level of stand openness did not change. The response of saproxylic beetles to delayed harvesting was weaker than the structural changes in deadwood features. Nevertheless, long-established reserves showed higher species richness and slightly but significantly dissimilar species assemblages than recently harvested plots. Indeed even if only some guilds weakly increased in non-harvested plots, harvesting classes significantly affected the abundance of a quarter of the species tested. Our results tend to question measures such as rotating and temporarily ageing patches. We argue in favor of permanent strict fixed-location reserves. Future work should examine how stands recover old-growth forest attributes and how the associated saproxylic fauna colonizes in the long term. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract = {The quality of spatial data is limited by the accuracy of their sources such as paper maps and satellite images. It is also reduced by errors in map digitization and photo interpretation. Spatial operations performed on spatial data such as map overlay, buffer operations and spatial smoothing, do not always work correctly because their accuracy depends on the quality of spatial data. The present paper evaluates the accuracy of the buffer operation on a point and a line segment in relation to the positional accuracy of spatial data. Two quantitative measures are introduced to assess the accuracy of the buffer operation. Their explicit forms are derived for a point, and a condition is presented where the measures can be evaluated efficiently by numerical calculation. Applications provide empirical findings that deepen our understanding of the relationship between the accuracy of spatial data and that of the buffer operation.},

abstract = {Managing for multiple ecosystem services is a growing issue for forest managers. As trade-offs arise between conflicting management objectives, stakeholders must be informed of the possible outcomes of alternative choices in order to facilitate decision-making. We modelled stand dynamics under single-management and functional zoning multiple-management (TRIAD; i.e. three-zone) scenarios in different forest types typical of eastern North America with the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Timber production, carbon stocking and habitat quality ecosystem services were calculated with simulation outputs. Habitat quality was measured using a habitat suitability index that integrated stand structural indicators. A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed in order to rank scenarios. We show that the most intensive management yielded greater timber volumes but resulted in the weakest carbon and habitat quality scores. The TRIAD scenarios in sugar maple–beech stands offered the best compromise in services compared to single management. In shade-intolerant deciduous stands, there was a loss of timber production with TRIAD scenarios, but greater carbon stock and habitat quality were observed. Our study contrasts alternative management scenarios for ecosystem services in woodlots of different forest types. It confirms that multiple harvest systems better achieve multiple services. The coupling of simulation modelling with MCDA offers a simple and flexible method to help stakeholders and managers make sound decisions.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {A summary of the present knowledge of variation in individual quality within a bark beetle population is given, with emphasis on the spruce bark beetle Ip.t t$\backslash$po{\^{}}raphus. A major causal factor is density, mediated by competition during larval development. Density negatively influences individual quality measured as weight, fat content and pheromone production. Together with decreasing mean values at higher densities, the skewness of the frequency distributions goes from negative to positive, while variance changes little. High densities, which often oecur in the field, thus result in a large fraction of "low quality beetles". They have lower reproductive capacity and presumably lesser dispersal ability, lower survival, and earlier response to pheromone. This might eoncentrate the population in the next generation with increased competition as a result. It is suggested that a decrease in beetle "quality" due to increasingly intense intraspecific competition can contribute to the decline ot an epidemic population.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved. Managing forest resources occurs under various sources of uncertainty. Depending on the management problem, this uncertainty may have a substantial impact on the quality of the solution. As our knowledge on the sources and magnitude of uncertainty improves, integrating this knowledge into the development of management plans becomes increasingly useful, as additional information can improve the decision-making process. This adjustment requires a fundamental shift in how planning problems are viewed: instead of interpreting risk management as a technique needed only for addressing problems with natural hazards, risk management should be an integral part of most planning problems. Managing risks can be linked to a variety of adaptive planning methods: to help mitigate risk, either plans should be revised as new information becomes available or the possibility of adaptation should be accounted for in preparing the plans. We conduct a brief examination of the key topics in risk management and highlight how risk management implies trade-offs. Several decision problems that incorporate risk management are analyzed, and alternative perspectives for the problem are suggested to better address risk management issues. We then provide a decision framework for considering how to integrate risk management practices into the forest planning process.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved. Forest planning at the landscape level has the potential to become a large intractable problem. In Finland, Mets{\"{a}}hallitus (the state enterprise that manages federally owned land) creates strategic plans to determine the appropriate harvest level. While these plans are feasible, they are not implementable in practice as the harvests are scattered temporally and spatially. Requiring that harvests be organized both temporally and spatially for practical implementation can result in an intractable problem. Through a hierarchical approach, the problem can be organized into steps in which the intractable problem is broken down into smaller easily solvable parts. As an approximation technique, the hierarchical approach may not find a solution close to optimality. To meet this challenge, we combine the top hierarchical level problems with a limited selection of lower hierarchical level problems into a single optimization problem. An iterative process is then used to improve the link between the hierarchical levels. We evaluate the landscape-level management plans developed by the iterative approach with a solution to the complete problem. The iterative process dramatically improves the strategic solution, performing near the global optimum. This suggests that the process can be applied to more computationally challenging problems such as spatial planning and stochastic programming.},

Effects on microclimate, water, soil, nutrient cycling, and the diversity and composition of plant and animal species are reviewed. The effects of clear-cutting vary considerably depending on site conditions (such as climate, geology, and topography) and on the structure and composition of the forest, the extent and distribution of harvesting, the method used to extract the logs, and the length of time before the forest is removed again.

The latter is further explored and considered as a key factor in understanding the occurrence of natural disasters, and consequently, in developing and applying adequate strategies for prevention. Terms such as natural and human vulnerabilities are introduce and explained as target aspects to be taken into account in the reduction of vulnerability and for prevention and mitigation of natural disasters.

The current$\backslash$nstudy aims at characterizing and quantifying the impacts of topography$\backslash$non landscape connectivity. We focus on ?hilltopping? behavior in$\backslash$nbutterflies, a dispersal-like behavior where males and virgin females$\backslash$nascend to mountain summits and mate there. Our approach integrates$\backslash$nthree elements: an individual-based model for simulating animal movements$\backslash$nacross topographically heterogeneous landscapes; a formula for the$\backslash$naccessibility of patches in homogenous landscapes; and a graphical$\backslash$nanalysis of the plots of the simulation-based vs. the formula-based$\backslash$naccessibility values. We characterize the functional relationship$\backslash$nbetween accessibility values and landscape structure (referred to$\backslash$nas ?accessibility patterns?) and analyze the influence of two factors:$\backslash$nthe intensity of the individuals? response to topography, and the$\backslash$nlevel of topographical noise. We show that, despite the diversity$\backslash$nof topographical landscapes, animal response to topography results$\backslash$nin the formation of two, quantifiable accessibility patterns. We$\backslash$nterm them ?effectively homogeneous? and ?effectively channeled?.$\backslash$nThe latter, in which individuals move toward a single summit, prevails$\backslash$nover a wide range of behavioral and spatial parameters. Therefore,$\backslash$n?channeled? accessibilities may occur in a variety of landscapes$\backslash$nand contexts. Our work provides novel tools for understanding and$\backslash$npredicting accessibility patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. These$\backslash$ntools are essential for linking movement behavior, movement patterns$\backslash$nand connectivity. We also present new insights into the practical$\backslash$nvalue of ecologically scaled landscape indices.},

Water, forest, agricultural areas, grasslands, transport network, urban, airport- industrial units and barren land- mine land cover/use classes adapted from CORINE nomenclature were used as main land cover/use classes to identify. To fulfil the aims of this research, recently acquired dated 08/02/2016 Sentinel-2 and dated 22/02/2016 Landsat-8 images of Istanbul were obtained and image pre-processing steps like atmospheric and geometric correction were employed. Both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images were resampled to 30m pixel size after geometric correction and similar spectral bands for both satellites were selected to create a similar base for these multi-sensor data. Maximum Likelihood (MLC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classification methods were applied to both data sets to accurately identify eight different land cover/ use classes. Error matrix was created using same reference points for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 classifications. After the classification accuracy, results were compared to find out the best approach to create current land cover/use map of the region. The results of MLC and SVM classification methods were compared for both images.},

abstract = {Natural hazards caused by insect outbreaks, such as those induced by the European bark beetle (Ips typographus L.), are among the most extensive disturbances affecting forest health in various geographical regions. Accurate and up-to-date knowledge of the spatial distribution of bark beetle-infested trees is critical for forest managers to effectively plan appropriate countermeasures and predict future bark beetle infestation dynamics. In this study, three scenarios for mapping bark beetle-induced tree mortality based on airborne hyperspectral data (HyMap) were examined including combining a genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection with a supervised support vector machine (SVM) classification. The scenarios differed in how the mortality classes (used to extract the spectral signatures) were defined. Scenario 1 included three mortality classes, while Scenario 2 and 3 each included only one general mortality-related class but with different definitions. The classes, derived from the three scenarios, served as inputs into feature selection facilitated by the GA. The most stable bands, selected by the GA, were then used as input bands for a bootstrapped supervised SVM classification procedure. In two of the three scenarios, the trained classifier was additionally applied to a second independent hyperspectral image to evaluate the stability of the spectral signatures derived from the training samples. The classification procedure was further refined by varying the number of input bands and the input data types, where the bands not only included the original reflectances of the HyMap images but also a first order Savitzky-Golay derivation and continuum-removed spectra. The results of the study indicate that an accurate differentiation of three mortality classes was not possible with the applied methodology. The defined pre-visual "green mortality stage" class in particular was found to be heavily overestimated based on the qualitative analysis of the classified maps and validation statistics (error of commission 65{\%} as shown by the user's accuracy).However, on the other hand, the mapping of dead trees was possible with notably high overall accuracies (OAs) (84{\%}-96{\%}). These results could also be transferred to the second independent hyperspectral image, in which the separation between the healthy trees and the dead trees was possible with OAs of 94{\%}-97{\%}. Somewhat lower but still reasonable OAs (76{\%}-85{\%}) were found when all defined classes were considered. The main confusion occurred between dead trees and sparsely vegetated soil. GA analysis showed that bands that notably contributed to high classification accuracies were frequently located in the visual part of the spectrum, close to the green peak (560. nm), as well as around the chlorophyll absorption feature (680. nm) and the red edge rise (690. nm). In some of the tested cases, additional bands in the SWIR (1532. nm) and one in the NIR (1076. nm) were stably selected by the GA, which indicated the importance of these bands in the classification process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Richter2011,
abstract = {The objective of any radiometric correction of airborne and spaceborne imagery of optical sensors is the extraction of physical earth surface parameters such as spectral albedo, directional reflectance quantities, emissivity, and temperature. To achieve this goal, the influence of the atmosphere, solar illumination, sensor viewing geometry, and terrain information have to be taken into account. Although a lot of information from airborne and satellite imagery can be extracted without radio- metric correction, the physical model based approach as implemented in ATCOR offers advantages, especially when dealing with multitemporal data and when a comparison of different sensors is re- quired. In addition, the full potential of imaging spectrometers can only be exploited with this approach. Although physical models can be quite successful to eliminate atmospheric and topographic ef- fects they inherently rely on an accurate spectral and radiometric sensor calibration and on the accuracy and appropriate spatial resolution of a digital elevation model (DEM) in rugged terrain. In addition, many surfaces have a bidirectional reflectance behavior, i.e., the reflectance depends on the illumination and viewing geometry. The usual assumption of an isotropic or Lambertian reflectance law is appropriate for small field-of-view (FOV {\textless} 30o, scan angle {\textless} ±15o) sensors if viewing does not take place in the solar principal plane. However, for large FOV sensors and / or data recording close to the principal plane the anisotropic reflectance behavior of natural surfaces causes brightness gradients in the image. These effects can be removed with an empirical method that normalizes the data to nadir reflectance values. In addition, for rugged terrain areas illumi- nated under low local solar elevation angles, these effects also play a role and can be taken care of with an empirical method included in the ATCOR package. The ATCOR software was developed to cover about 80{\%} of the typical cases with a reasonable amount of coding. It is difficult if not impossible to achieve satisfactory results for all possible cases. Special features of ATCOR are the consideration of topographic effects and the capability to process thermal band imagery. There are two ATCOR models available, one for satellite imagery, the other one for airborne imagery ([77], [78]). The satellite version of ATCOR supports all major commercially available small-to- medium FOV sensors with a sensor-specific atmospheric database of look-up tables (LUTs) con- taining the results of pre-calculated radiative transfer calculations. New sensors will be added on demand. The current list of supported sensors is available at this web address. A simple interface has been added to provide the possibility to include user-defined instruments. It is mainly intended for hyperspectral sensors where the center wavelength of channels is not stable and a re-calculation of atmospheric LUTs is required, e.g., Hyperion, Chris-Proba. An integral part of all ATCOR versions is a large database containing the results of radiative transfer calculations based on the Modtran R ?5 code (Berk et al. 1998, 2008). While ATCOR uses the AFRL MODTRAN code to calculate the database of atmospheric look-up tables (LUT), the correctness of the LUT's is the responsibility of ATCOR. Historical note: For historic reasons, the satellite codes are called ATCOR-2 (flat terrain, two geometric degrees- of-freedom DOF [65]) and ATCOR-3 (three DOF's, mountainous terrain [68]). They support all commercially available small to medium FOV satellite sensors with a sensor-specific atmospheric database. The scan angle dependence of the atmospheric correction functions within a scene is neglected here. The airborne version is called ATCOR-4, to indicate the four geometric DOF's x, y, z, and scan angle [71]. It includes the scan angle dependence of the atmospheric correction functions, a nec- essary feature, because most airborne sensors have a large FOV up to 60◦- 90◦. While satellite sensors always operate outside the atmosphere, airborne instruments can operate in altitudes of a few hundred meters up to 20 km. So the atmospheric database has to cover a range of altitudes. Since there is no standard set of airborne instruments and the spectral / radiometric performance might change from year to year due to sensor hardware modifications, a monochromatic atmo- spheric database was compiled based on the Modtran R ?5 radiative transfer code. This database has to be resampled for each user-defined sensor.},

Some conifer species, particularly members of the pine family, are susceptible to attack by tree-killing bark beetles and their symbiotic microorganisms. The beetle-symbiont complex can overwhelm the defenses of healthy trees through pheromone-mediated mass attacks. However, most of the time, the trees' effective preformed and inducible defenses protect them from attack and regulate bark beetle populations at low, endemic levels. Conifers integrate multiple defense mechanisms, including preformed and inducible specialized metabolites (particularly terpenoids and phenolics), though mechanical barriers (periderms, lignified cells, crystals), and other chemical, molecular, and mechanical defenses. Anthropogenic disturbances, such as climate change and range expansion of invasive species, reduce tree vigor and create new pest-conifer associations at an increasing rate. These threats accentuate the need for a more detailed understanding of the interactions between conifer defenses and the bark beetle-symbiont complex.},

the expansion of private ownership over agricultural and forest land
against the collective and state property that has been characteristic
of the previous period. So, the large collective and state farms from
the communist period gave way to small, peasant-type family farms,
leading to noticeable fragmentation of the agricultural land. As to the

In Europe, over the period 1950-2000, insect damage (which equates mostly to bark beetles) ranked third, with 8{\%} of the total damage due to forest disturbances. The damage amounted to 2.88 million m3 per year between 1958 and 2001. The major direct economic consequences of these outbreaks have been widely analyzed, various mitigation methods have been designed and implemented, and diverse political, industrial, and commercial initiatives have been developed to salvage the remains of the devastated forests. However, the many other environmental and sociological consequences of these disturbances are still largely unexplored. Significant progress has been made in analyzing the multi-scale positive influence of bark beetle activity, from the landscape to the stand level, as well as the various socioeconomic changes brought by bark beetle outbreaks. Silvicultural, environmental, and social consequences of bark beetle outbreaks are described and discussed, as well as the different issues related to the salvage of damaged forests. The wider context of management policies, including risk management and exotic species management, is discussed.

Many bark beetle life history traits that influence population success are temperature dependent, and climate change will therefore cause significant alterations to bark beetle population dynamics, both positive and negative. Many species have responded to increased temperature and reduced precipitation in the past decade, and projected global changes will undoubtedly continue to manifest through alterations in bark beetle population outbreaks and shifts in species distributions. To adequately manage future forest and agriculture ecosystems, knowledge of potential bark beetle impacts in a changing climate will be required. Despite the importance of climate in predicting bark beetle outbreaks, only six species have sufficient information for development of mechanistic and statistical models. We review mechanistic phenology models that incorporate thermally dependent physiological processes that control survival and seasonality (i.e., development, diapause, cold tolerance), and ecosystem models that describe the effect of climate and host plant conditions on bark beetle population abundance using statistical and analytical techniques.

abstract = {Introduction: Land exchange can be a major factor driving land-use change in regions with high pressure on land, but is generally not incorporated in land-use change models. Here we present an agent-based model to simulate land-use change arising from land exchange between multiple agent types representing farmers, nature organizations, and estate owners. Methods: The RULEX model (Rural Land EXchange) was calibrated and applied to a 300 km2 case study area in the east of the Netherlands. Decision rules about which actor will sell and buy land, as well as which specific land to buy or sell are based on historical observations, interviews, and choice experiments. Results: A reconstruction of land-use change for the period 2001–2009 demonstrates that RULEX reproduces most observed land-use trends and patterns. Given that RULEX simulates only one mechanism of land-use change, i.e. land exchange, it is conservative in simulating change. Conclusions: With this model, we demonstrate the potential of incorporating land market processes in an agent-based, land-use change model. This supports understanding of land-use change that is brought about by ownership change, which is an important process in areas where pressure on land is high. The soundness of the process representation was corroborated by stakeholders within the study area. Land exchange models can be used to assess the impact of changes in climate, markets, and policy on land use change, and help to increase effectiveness of alternative land purchasing strategies by stakeholders or spatial planning policy. {\textcopyright} 2014, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Outbreaks of cambium-feeding beetles follow droughts, becoming most severe in overmature trees and those growing on stressful sites or planted beyond their natural range. Outbreaks develop from small endemic populations confined to a few senescing or damaged trees and expand into neighbouring trees that become newly stressed as a drought intensifies, eventually coalescing as a full-blown outbreak. The beetles' larvae normally face a severe nutritional challenge feeding on the slow outflow of dilute nutrients in the phloem of damaged or senescing trees. This is reflected in their slow rate of growth. But when drought stresses trees, they senesce more quickly, releasing a faster flow of more concentrated nutrients that enhances the survival of the insects. The increased survival and faster rate of growth of larvae feeding in this enriched phloem can generate an outbreak. Both the dieback of the trees and the outbreaks of these insects are generated by drought. This hypothesis presents a parsimonious explanation for outbreaks of cambium-feeding insects. Apart from providing a focus for future research, it has the added benefit that it replaces non-explanatory descriptions of these outbreaks with a testable biological explanation based on known plant and insect physiology.},

Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, each country has approached forest monitoring, protection and the improvement of forest conditions in its own way. Spaceborne remote sensing of forest changes across country borders offers great potential for better understanding the underlying drivers of change and for developing comparable indicators between countries. For this paper we evaluated how forests changed in the border region of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia between 1987 and 2005 and how these changes depended on industrial transformations before and after 1989. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to assess forest cover change between 1987 and 2005. Our results showed that 8.12{\%} of the forest stands in our study region were degraded either partially or completely during that time period, a percentage that equals 14,972 ha of the area's total forest cover. At the same time, 7.57{\%} (13,951 ha) of the area were reforested or regenerated on previously damaged forest stands. Forest changes were similar in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but differed in Poland. Comparing forest composition, topography, and aspect with forest decline revealed the importance of forest management and pollution legacies from communist times when explaining today's forest disturbance patterns. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to gauge the effectiveness of using SPOT-5 10-m multispectral imagery to detect and map red-attack damage for an area near Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada. A logistic regression model was used to incorporate SPOT imagery with elevation and associated derivatives for red- attack detection and mapping. Separate independent sets of calibration and validation data, collected via a detailed aerial survey, were used to train the classification algorithm and vet the output maps of red-attack damage. The output from the logistic regression model was a continuous surface indicating the probabil- ity of red-attack damage. Using a greater than 50{\%} probability threshold, red-attack was mapped with 71{\%} accuracy (with a 95{\%} confidence interval of ±9{\%}). This level of accuracy is comparable to that achieved with Landsat single-date imagery in an area with similar levels of infestation. If a synoptic view of mountain pine beetle red-attack damage at the landscape level is required, and if Landsat data are unavailable, SPOT-5 10-m multispectral imagery may be considered an alternative data source, albeit an expensive one, for detecting and mapping mountain pine beetle red-attack damage.},

abstract = {Nature protection as a policy sector is not isolated and is directly or indirectly influenced by many other sectors (e.g. forestry, water management, rural development, energy, etc.). These policy sectors are neither completely segmented nor unaffected by the decisions taken in other policy sectors. Policy formulation in nature protection is therefore also influenced by different sectors. For that reason it is inevitable to stress the need for inter-sectoral coordination to assure their policy coherence. The aim of this article is to describe the mechanism and modes of cross-sectoral coordination and to analyze the relevant actors and their interaction, using the case of the Natura 2000 formulation process in Slovakia. The European Union (EU) set up an ecological network of special protected areas, known as Natura 2000 to ensure biodiversity by conserving natural habitats and wild fauna and flora in the territory of the Member States. An optimized nature protection must therefore carefully consider existing limits and crossdisciplinary relationships at the EU, national and regional levels.The relations between forestry and biodiversity protection are analyzed using the advocacy coalition framework (ACF). The ACF is used for analyzing how two coalitions, in this case ecological and forest owners' coalitions, advocate or pursue their beliefs from the nature protection and forestry policy field. The whole process is illustrated at the regional scale on the case study of Natura 2000 sites formulation in the Slovak Republic.For better reliability and validity of research, a combination of various empiric research methods was used, supported by existing theories. So called triangulation of sociological research or triangulation of methods consists of mutual results testing of individual methodological steps through identifying corresponding political-science theories, assessing their formal points using primary and secondary document analysis and assessing their informal points with standardized interviews with experts.We can conclude that adequate cross-sectoral coordination represented by new modes is missing and the formulation of the Natura 2000 network in Slovakia shows deficits resulting from different policy beliefs concerning nature protection and forestry coalition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Disturbances shape forest structure and composition, but the temporal dynamics of disturbance patterns, their influence on dynamics of forest structural complexity, and the potential impacts of ongoing climate changes are not fully understood. We addressed these issues by focusing on (1) long-term, landscape level retrospective analysis of disturbance dynamics of mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest; (2) testing for the prevailing disturbance agent; and (3) the detection of disturbance drivers, particularly site conditions, using a dendrochronological approach.We had a unique opportunity to sample a large area of natural forest (in otherwise altered region) in Bohemian Forest, that was recently affected by extensive and severe wind and bark beetle disturbances raising management concerns. Tree-ring series of a minimum of 35 trees on each of the 26 study plots were analysed for signals of past disturbances that were indicated either by release from suppression (rapid growth increase) or rapid early growth rate (gap origin).A broad range of disturbance severities were detected across the landscape, but severe disturbances ({\textless}50{\%} trees responded), with a short rotation period of 174. years, best characterize the area. Reconstructed disturbances were associated with historically documented windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks. They were distributed across the landscape and affected its large portions with spatially variable severity. Over the last five centuries, disturbances peaked in the 1820s, but were rare after 1880. This non-equilibrium dynamics resulted into mature landscape structure at the end of 20th century and contributed to the large extent of disturbances in the last two decades. Disturbances were more frequent on wind-exposed locations such as mountain ridges and flatter terrain.Frequent disturbances did not allow the forest to develop into an old-growth phase; rather disturbance events of variable severities created structures important for biodiversity and could also preserve key early-seral phases in the landscape. We anticipate that potential future increase of disturbance intensities will not lead to comparable regime shifts in forests shaped by high-severity disturbances that kill largely mature trees (e.g., wind and bark beetle), because such disturbances are followed by resistant forest structure. Conservation areas should be large enough to allow for a wide range of disturbances. Emphasizing ecological functions needs understanding of biological legacies of natural disturbances and managers could partly rely on natural events to restore natural features into cultivated forests.},

abstract = {Storm events resulting in windthrows, bark beetle (. Ips typographus) outbreaks and subsequent forestry operations are the main disturbance agents in European mountain Norway spruce (. Picea abies) forests. In the 1990s, a bark beetle outbreak resulted in a large-scale dieback of semi-natural mountain spruce forests in the {\v{S}}umava National Park, Czech Republic. Two applied management measures enabled long-term monitoring of the effect of natural and anthropogenic disturbance on forest recovery: core zones were left without intervention, and surrounding zones were clear-cut, trees removed, and cleared areas replanted. Research plots were established in three disturbance types: climatically conditioned spruce forest with dead canopy, without intervention (1), with intervention (2), and waterlogged spruce forest partly resistant to bark beetle disturbance without intervention (3). The amount and vertical structure of tree regeneration and vegetation changes have been studied since the beginning of the disturbance in 1997.The main question of the study was whether tree regeneration and herb-layer vegetation differed between naturally developing disturbed forests and clearcuts 15. years after the disturbance. The species composition of regeneration in all disturbance types consisted mainly of spruce, with accompanying rowan. The total numbers after 15. years since the beginning of the disturbance did not differ significantly among the studied disturbance types, and were sufficient to replace the previous canopy. However, in clearcuts, these numbers were achieved by artificial reforestation, which was applied after initial destruction of natural regeneration due to salvage operations, whereas advance natural regeneration grew successfully under the protection of unmanaged dead canopy. There was a more unified height structure of spruce regeneration in the clearcuts, with significantly higher numbers of saplings taller than 2. m compared to unmanaged forests. Due to a less harsh change in site conditions, typical herb species flourished in the non-intervention zones in comparison to the clearcuts. The impact of post-disturbance interventions on herb-layer vegetation was still obvious 15. years after the event. Therefore, a non-interventional approach is recommended as the best for restoration of mountain Norway spruce forests affected by large-scale natural disturbances.},

abstract = {It: is generally recognized that estimating the accuracy of maps that are derived from remotely sensed data requires statistical sampling of photographs or ground plots to insure that the estimates are reliable and cost effective. The usual method is to cross-tabulate the categories identified for these plots with the categories associated with corresponding areas on the map in a table called a "contingency table." From this table, measures of map accuracy ("proportion-correct") areusuallyobtained by ratioing diagonal entries by marginal sums or by the total number of points in the table. Frequently, one has knowledge of the true map category marginal proportions, that is, the relative areas of each map category. These map category proportions can be used to improve estimates of "proportion-correct" for each map category. This paper de- rives these improved estimates with their asymptotic variances for two common sampling designs: simple random sampling of single points and sampling stratified by map category. A numerical example illustrates the computations.},

abstract = {In the context of detection of weeds in crops for site-specific weed control, on-ground spectral reflectance measurements are the first step to determine the potential of remote spectral data to classify weeds and crops. Field studies were conducted for four years at different locations in Spain. We aimed to distinguish cruciferous weeds in wheat and broad bean crops, using hyperspectral and multispectral readings in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. To identify differences in reflectance between cruciferous weeds, we applied three classification methods: stepwise discriminant (STEPDISC) analysis and two neural networks, specifically, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). Hyperspectral and multispectral signatures of cruciferous weeds, and wheat and broad bean crops can be classified using STEPDISC analysis, and MLP and RBF neural networks with different success, being the MLP model the most accurate with 100{\%}, or higher than 98.1{\%}, of classification performance for all the years. Classification accuracy from hyperspectral signatures was similar to that from multispectral and spectral indices, suggesting that little advantage would be obtained by using more expensive airborne hyperspectral imagery. Therefore, for next investigations, we recommend using multispectral remote imagery to explore whether they can potentially discriminate these weeds and crops.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review: In this review, we highlight recent developments and applications in remote sensing that can improve the accuracy and timeliness of health assessments in plantations managed for timber and pulp production. The detection and mapping of damage extent and severity caused by insect pests and fungal pathogens is a common requirement of foresters managing plantations. The objectives of these surveys can range from early detection for targeted intervention to more strategic aims of predicting stand susceptibility or evaluating the performance of management strategies. Recent Findings: Recent developments in remote sensing technologies and big data modelling techniques can now provide spatially explicit, quantitative solutions for these management objectives that are more accurate than manual field-based assessments of tree damage or airborne visual mapping. Past studies have identified a large number of spectral, textural and structural metrics that have been used in models to classify specific tree crown damage symptoms. This process requires a detailed understanding of the chronology of crown symptoms for specific damaging agents and the spectral responses to these symptoms. Continuing increases in the spatial and spectral resolution of remote sensors enables crown-level damage classification. Summary: The development of data processing workflows that fuse spectral information with three-dimensional (3D) data acquired simultaneously from single or different remote platforms promote the opportunities to derive both structural and physiological crown-level attributes that relate to crown damage. The simultaneous acquisition of spectral and 3D point data will enable plantation foresters to derive several spatial products, including the assessment of tree health in a cost-effective manner.},

abstract = {Comprehensive survey of key methods in spatial science Well written and understandable Features the very best scholars in the field Spatial data are an important source of scientific information. The development of high capacity and fast desk and laptop computers and the concomitant creation of geographic information systems has made it possible to explore georeferenced or mapped data as never before. This Handbook summarizes, explains, and demonstrates the nature of current models, methods, and techniques particularly designed for the analysis of spatial data. The book is designed to be a desk reference for all researchers just getting into the field of spatial data analysis as well as for seasoned spatial analysts. Relevant references are given whenever possible to direct researchers to the most useful writings on the subject. Unlike most compendia of this nature, the book starts out by exploring the available software for spatial analysis. We focus on the tools that make analysis possible. The volume then describes briefly but clearly the many techniques embodied in the fields of exploratory spatial data analysis, spatial statistics, geostatistics, and spatial econometrics. In addition, attention is given to the methods used for the analysis of remotely sensed data. Finally, a number of example sections are included that demonstrate the application of spatial analysis in the economic, environmental, and health sciences. The wide range of approaches described helps readers better understand their data and the techniques needed for spatial analysis. The volume features contributions from the very best scholars in the field. Their explanations are able to communicate the fundamental ideas of their subject area succinctly and accessibly.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017. Current debates on ‘crimes against humanity' address its history and its potentially neo-imperial effects in international relations. In reference to these issues, this essay abstracts the idea of universal crime from the contemporary concept of ‘crimes against humanity' and analyzes its mobilizations in early-modern perspectives on the legitimacy of European colonialism. First theorizing the easy union between notions of universal crime and arguments about European imperialism, I then draw on arguments by Vitoria, Gentili, and Grotius. I find that they rely on the idea of an offense injuring all mankind to negotiate colonial relationships between European powers and peoples abroad as well as between European powers vis-{\`{a}}-vis one another, both within Europe and in non-European spaces. The essay concludes by offering three venues for inquiry into the concepts of universal crime and crimes against humanity, namely their political productivity, their historical circulation, and their contemporary neo-imperial character.},

abstract = {Aim
We develop a novel modelling framework for analysing the spatio-temporal spread of biological invasions. The framework integrates different invasion drivers and disentangles their roles in determining observed invasion patterns by fitting models to historical distribution data. As a case study application, we analyse the spread of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia).


Location
Central Europe.


Methods
A lattice system represents actual landscapes with environmental heterogeneity. Modelling covers the spatio-temporal invasion sequence in this grid and integrates the effects of environmental conditions on local invasion suitability, the role of invaded cells and spatially implicit “background” introductions as propagule sources, within-cell invasion level bulk-up and multiple dispersal means. A modular framework design facilitates flexible numerical representation of the modelled invasion processes and customization of the model complexity. We used the framework to build and contrast increasingly complex models, and fitted them using a Bayesian inference approach with parameters estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).


Results
All modelled invasion drivers codetermined the A. artemisiifolia invasion pattern. Inferences about individual drivers depended on which processes were modelled concurrently, and hence changed both quantitatively and qualitatively between models. Among others, the roles of environmental variables were assessed substantially differently subject to whether models included explicit source-recipient cell relationships, spatio-temporal variability in source cell strength and human-mediated dispersal means. The largest fit improvements were found by integrating filtering effects of the environment and spatio-temporal availability of propagule sources.


Main conclusions
Our modelling framework provides a straightforward means to build integrated invasion models and address hypotheses about the roles and mutual relationships of different putative invasion drivers. Its statistical nature and generic design make it suitable for studying many observed invasions. For efficient invasion modelling, it is important to represent changes in spatio-temporal propagule supply by explicitly tracking the species' colonization sequence and establishment of new populations.},

abstract = {Background Forest management in Europe is committed to sustainability. In the face of climate change and accompanying risks, however, planning in order to achieve this aim becomes increasingly challenging, underlining the need for new and innovative methods. Models potentially integrate a wide range of system knowledge and present scenarios of variables important for any management decision. In the past, however, model development has mainly focused on specific purposes whereas today we are increasingly aware of the need for the whole range of information that can be provided by models. It is therefore assumed helpful to review the various approaches that are available for specific tasks and to discuss how they can be used for future management strategies. Scope Here we develop a concept for the role of models in forest ecosystem management based on historical analyses. Five paradigms of forest management are identified: (1) multiple uses, (2) dominant use, (3) environmentally sensitive multiple uses, (4) full ecosystem approach and (5) eco-regional perspective. An overview of model approaches is given that is dedicated to this purpose and to developments of different kinds of approaches. It is discussed how these models can contribute to goal setting, decision support and development of guidelines for forestry operations. Furthermore, it is shown how scenario analysis, including stand and landscape visualization, can be used to depict alternatives, make long-term consequences of different options transparent, and ease participation of different stakeholder groups and education. Conslusions In our opinion, the current challenge of forest ecosystem management in Europe is to integrate system knowledge from different temporal and spatial scales and from various disciplines. For this purpose, using a set of models with different focus that can be selected from a kind of toolbox according to particular needs is more promising than developing one overarching model, covering ecological, production and landscape issues equally well.},

abstract = {1. Ecosystem services (ES) from mountain forests are highly relevant for human societies. ES with a direct economic support function (e.g. timber production), regulatory services (e.g. protection from natural hazards) and cultural services (e.g. recreation) are likely to be affected strongly by a rapidly changing climate. To evaluate whether adverse climate change effects on ES can be counteracted by adapting management, dynamic models and indicator-based assessments are needed. 2. We applied a forest dynamic model in case study areas of four European mountain regions and evaluated the future supply of four ES – timber production, carbon sequestra-tion, biodiversity and protection against natural hazards – using state-of-the-art ES indica-tors. Forest dynamics were simulated under three management scenarios (no management, business-as-usual and alternative management) and five climate change projections for selected representative stand types in each region. We analysed potential trade-offs and syn-ergies between ES and evaluated future changes among regions, forest stands, climate and management scenarios. 3. Impacts of climate change on the provision of multiple ES were found to be highly hetero-geneous and to depend on the region, site and future climate. In the absence of large-scale natural disturbance (not considered), protection services, carbon stock and deadwood abun-dance (proxy for biodiversity) benefitted from no management in all regions. Negative impacts of climate change were evident for the provision of multiple ES but limited to the most severe climate scenarios and low-elevation stands. Synergies and trade-offs between the majority of ES were found to be sensitive to the choice of management strategy and – in some regions – to climate change. 4. Synthesis and applications. Management regimes in European mountain forests should be regionally adapted to stand and site conditions. Although in some cases alternative manage-ment regimes may be more suitable than current management for supporting multiple ecosys-tem services, adaptation options should be evaluated carefully at the local scale due to the highly different magnitude of the impacts of climate change in different regions and along elevation gradients.},

abstract = {Model testing procedures represent a major challenge in the development of agent-based models (ABMs). However, they are required stages for a model to be accepted and to serve as a forecasting, management or decision-making tool. This study presents a comprehensive approach for testing ForestSimMPB, an agent-based model (ABM) designed to simulate mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, outbreaks at the scale of individual trees. ForestSimMPB is a complex system model that is using swarming intelligence, capable to represent individuals' behaviours and spatial interactions that influence their surrounding environment. Swarm Intelligence (SI) methods are integrated into the ABM in order to reproduce the collective reasoning and indirect communication of autonomous agents representing MPB behaviour within the forest environment. Model testing approach consist of verification, calibration, sensitivity analysis, validation and qualification stages. Model testing is accomplished by simulating MPB infestations using both the ForestSimMPB model and a Random-ABM model that serves as a null model. Outcomes comparison and assessment are performed using raster-based techniques as well as spatial metrics. Aerial photographs of the British Columbia, Canada study sites are used in this model testing approach. Results indicate that ForestSimMPB model representations of MPB outbreaks are more similar than Random model representations to the spatial distribution of MPB-dead trees. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = { Damages by wind and by European spruce bark beetle ( I. typographus L.) were compared on the basis of the reports about the occurrence of harmful forest agents for the period 1964−1991 across former regional state forest directorates. In the given period, the quantity of salvage logging (70 million m 3 ) was more than five times that of sanitation felling (13 million m 3 ). Damage intensity increased over the decades. Using a cross-correlation function between the time series, an increase in the abundance of I. typographus due to windfall was demonstrated with a delay of 1–3 years. Wind damage was also shown to arise as a result of disturbed stand stability after sanitation felling with a stochastic delay of 1−5 years. Thus, disturbance of static stability of forest stands may be considered as one of the main harmful consequences of bark beetle outbreaks for the near future. Consequences for forest management are discussed. },

In this work, $\beta$-CD-based polyurethane copolymers ($\beta$-CDPU) have been prepared by reacting $\beta$-CD with hexamethylene diisocyanate as cross-linked agent in dry DMF. This polymer showed high selectivity for preconcentration of Pb(II) at trace level prior to its flame atomic absorption spectrometric determination. The effect of several parameters such as pH, flow rate of sample, eluent kind and volume was investigated. The adsorption behaviors and mechanisms of Pb(II) on the samples were also studied. The maximum adsorption amount of Pb(II) was 8 mg g -1 with the preconcentration factor of 250 for Pb(II). The Langmuir isotherm was proved to describe the adsorption data better than the Freundlich isotherm and a pseudo-first-order kinetic model fits the adsorption kinetic processes well. The calibration curve was linear in the range of (3-200 ng mL -1 ) with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996. The limit of detection based on three times the standard deviation of the blank was 1.15 ng mL -1 . The relative standard deviations for the determination of 10 and 100 ng mL -1 of Pb(II) were 3.60 and 0.43 {\%} (n = 10), respectively. The method was successfully applied to the determination of lead in some environmental samples such as Tehran and Bushehr drinking water, river water and dust samples.},

abstract = {Mountain pine beetles [MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae (Hopkins)] normally exist as endemic populations that are characteristically scattered and restricted to suppressed and/or damaged pine trees which they colonize in association with an assemblage of secondary bark beetle species. We conducted a 4-year study (involving 7 stands at 2 sites in southern British Columbia) to 1) characterize the secondary bark beetle assemblage directly associated with endemic MPB populations; 2) determine the potential for secondary beetles to limit endemic MPB populations; 3) quantify the characteristics of lodgepole pine trees that mediate attack by the bole-infesting bark beetle guild; and 4) determine the critical temporal and spatial changes in trophic interactions that facilitate the transition of MPB populations from endemic to incipient-epidemic states. The secondary bole-infesting bark beetle assemblage comprised nine species that were consistent in their relative abundance from year to year in each stand, infesting up to 20 trees per ha in any given year. Within the secondary bark beetle assemblage, endemic MPB populations comprised fewer than 40 attacking female beetles distributed within ≤2 trees per ha. Endemic MPB preferentially colonized small, vigour-impaired trees with previous non-lethal infestations by one or more secondary bark beetle species. The volume of phloem consumed by MPB increased with increasing secondary activity suggesting that endemic MPB may benefit from their association with secondary beetles. During the course of the investigation, 4 of 7 stands experienced MPB population eruptions. In each case, eruptions were preceded by one or two years of elevated secondary bark beetle activity associated with an unusual drought period, suggesting that stress-induced increases in the abundance of secondary beetles within stands may facilitate MPB eruptions. The transition from endemic to incipient-epidemic populations was characterized by a density-dependent shift in colonization behaviour. As populations increased they rapidly shifted from small-diameter, widely dispersed, vigour-impaired trees with previous infestations by secondary bark beetles to clusters of large-diameter, vigorous, intact trees. The threshold density for the shift in colonization behaviour was estimated as 300-500 attacking female beetles per ha. The eruptive dynamics of mountain pine beetle arise as a consequence of interactions with bole-infesting secondary bark beetles that facilitate the maintenance of an endemic population. Eruptions occur when exogenous stress events (i.e. drought, windthrow, pathogens) increase the availability of vigour-impaired host trees within mature pine stands that enable the endemic MPB populations, maintained through the activities of the secondary beetle assemblage, to build sufficiently to access healthy, large-diameter trees.},

abstract = {Diapause was induced in a Central European population of Ips typographus grown at 20 degrees C when the day length decreased below 16 h [50{\%} diapause incidence occurred in the 14.7:9.3 h L:D (light:dark) regime]. The nondiapausing adults fed on days 2-6 and 10-14 after the ecdysis and swarmed after the second feeding bout with chorionated eggs in the ovaries and sperm in the spermiducts. Neither gonads nor the flight muscles matured and no swarming occurred in the diapausing adults. The development from egg to adult took about 34 days in both 18:6 h (no diapause) and 12:12 h L: D (diapause) regimes, but it was extended by up to 30{\%} without diapause induction when only larvae or pupae were exposed to L: D 12:12 h. Diapause was induced in insects reared at L: D 12:12 h through the last larval and the pupal instars and/or in the adult stage. Temperature 23 degrees C prevented diapause induction at L:D 12:12 h but diapause occurred at L: D 14:10 h associated with 26:6 degrees C thermoperiod. The effect of thermoperiods on the developmental rate requires further research. Exposure of the non-diapausing adults to 5 degrees C for several days blocked feeding and evoked a diapause- like state, whereas diapausing adults fed and their gonads slowly developed at this temperature. Diapausing adults exposed in forest to low night temperatures and transferred in October to 20 degrees C readily reproduced at 18:6, but not 12:12 h L: D photoperiods. After 2-months at 5 degrees C and darkness, they became insensitive to the photoperiod, matured and most of them also swarmed at 20 degrees C in the 12:12 h L:D regime. In a Scandinavian population, diapause occurred at 18:6 h L:D and was terminated either by exposure to 5 degrees C or by very long photoperiod (L:D 20:4 h) combined with high temperature (23 degrees C).},

abstract = {A novel algorithm is presented for detecting trophic status (chlorophyll-a), cyanobacterial blooms, surface scum and floating vegetation in coastal and inland waters using top-of-atmosphere data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The maximum peak-height algorithm (MPH) uses a baseline subtraction procedure to calculate the height of the dominant peak across the red and near-infrared MERIS bands between 664 and 885 nm caused by sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SICF) and particulate backscatter. Atmospheric correction of the MERIS TOA reflectance data for gaseous absorption and Rayleigh scattering proved adequate given the spectral proximity of the relevant bands and the sufficiently large differential spectral signal. This avoided the need to correct for atmospheric aerosols, a procedure which is typically prone to large errors in turbid and high-biomass waters. A combination of switching algorithms for estimating chl-a were derived from coincident in situ chl-a and MERIS bottom-of-Rayleigh reflectance measurements. These algorithms are designed to cover a wide trophic range, from oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters (chl-a{\textless}20 mg m(-3)), to eutrophic/hypertrophic waters (chl-a{\textgreater}20 mg m(-3)) and surface scums or dry floating algae or vegetation. Cyanobacteria-dominant waters were differentiated from those dominated by eukaryote algal species (dinoflagellates/diatoms) on the basis of the magnitude of the MPH variable. This is supported by evidence that vacuolate cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) possess enhanced chl-a specific backscatter which is an important bio-optical distinguishing feature. This enables these phytoplankton groups to be distinguished from space. An algorithm derived from cyanobacteria-dominant waters had a r(2) value of 0.58 for chl-a between 33 and 362 mg m(-3) and an error of 33.7{\%} (N=17). The operational algorithm for eukaryote-dominant algal assemblages gave a coefficient of determination of 0.71 and a mean absolute percentage error of 60{\%} for chl-a in the range 0.5-350 mg m(-3) (N=48). A flag based on cyanobacteria-specific spectral pigmentation and fluorescence features was used to identify cyanobacterial-dominance in eutrophic waters. Global applications demonstrate how the MPH algorithm can offer rapid and effective assessment of trophic status, cyanobacterial-dominance, surface scums and floating vegetation in inland and coastal waters.

abstract = {The mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a native insect of the pine forests of western North America, and its populations periodically erupt into large- scale outbreaks(1-3). During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large- scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks(4). Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000 - 2020 will be 270 megatonnes ( Mt) carbon ( or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km 2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to similar to 75{\%} of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959 - 1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change(5). Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak(6). Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large- scale modelling analyses.},

This review paper, which summarizes the methods and the results of digital change detection in the optical/infrared domain, has as its primary objective a synthesis of the state of the art today. It approaches digital change detection from three angles. First, the different perspectives from which the variability in ecosystems and the change events have been dealt with are summarized. Change detection between pairs of images (bi-temporal) as well as between time profiles of imagery derived indicators (temporal trajectories), and, where relevant, the appropriate choices for digital imagery acquisition timing and change interval length definition, are discussed. Second, pre-processing routines either to establish a more direct linkage between remote sensing data and biophysical phenomena, or to temporally mosaic imagery and extract time profiles, are reviewed. Third, the actual change detection methods themselves are categorized in an analytical framework and critically evaluated. Ultimately, the paper highlights how some of these methodological aspects are being fine-tuned as this review is being written, and we summarize the new developments that can be expected in the near future. The review highlights the high complementarity between different change detection methods.},

abstract = {Deadwood is an important component of forest ecosystems on which many forest dwelling species depend. Deadwood volume is therefore widely used as an indicator of forest biodiversity, notably throughout Europe. However, using deadwood as an indicator has mostly been based on boreal references, and published references for temperate forests are scarce. As a result, the magnitude of the relationship between deadwood volume and species richness remains unclear for saproxylic species. We used meta-analysis to study the correlation between deadwood volume and the species richness of saproxylic beetles and fungi relative to several predictors at the forest stand level: biome, type of deadwood (log, snag, and stump) and decay class (fresh vs. decayed). We showed that the correlation between deadwood volume and species richness of saproxylic organisms was significant but moderate (r = 0.31), and that it varied only slightly between logs and snags or between decay stages. However, we found a strong biome effect: deadwood volume and species richness were more correlated in boreal forests than in temperate forests. This could be attributed both to differences in the history of forest management between biomes and to varying landscape patterns. Finally, we conclude that total deadwood volume is probably not a sufficient indicator of saproxylic biodiversity, and those additional variables (notably at the landscape level) such as type of deadwood or decay class should be integrated in deadwood monitoring. In addition, further forest research is needed to better assess the quantitative relationship between deadwood and saproxylic biodiversity, and in order to build indicators adapted to different biome contexts.},

abstract = {Abstract. This study used Landsat-based detection of spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipen- nis) outbreak over the years 2000–2014 across the Southern Rocky Mountain Ecoregion to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of outbreak and assess the influence of temperature, drought, forest characteristics, and previous spruce beetle activity on outbreak development. During the 1999–2013 period, time series of spruce beetle activity were highly spatially corre- lated (r {\textgreater} 0.5) at distances {\textless}5 km, but remained weakly correlated (r = 0.08) at distances {\textgreater}400 km. Furthermore, cluster analysis on time series of outbreak activity revealed the outbreak developed at multiple incipient locations and spread to unaffected forest, highlight- ing the importance of both local-scale dispersal and regional-scale drivers in synchronizing spruce beetle outbreak. Spatial overlay analysis and Random Forest modeling of outbreak development show that outbreaks initiate in areas characterized by summer, winter, and multi- year drought and that outbreak spread is strongly linked to the proximity and extent of nearby outbreak, but remains associated with drought. Notably, we find that spruce beetle outbreak is associated with low peak snow water equivalent, not just summer drought. As such, future alterations to both winter and summer precipitation regimes are likely to drive important changes in subalpine forests},

abstract = {Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) play important roles in temperate conifer ecosystems, and also cause substantial economic losses. Although their general life histories are relatively similar, different species vary markedly in the physiological condition of the hosts they select. Most of ,6000 known species colonise dead or stressed trees, a resource they share with a large diversity of insects and other organisms. A small number of bark beetle species kill healthy, live trees. These few are of particular interest as they compete directly with humans for resources. We propose that tree killing evolved when intense interspecific competition in the ephemeral, scarce resource of defence-impaired trees selected for genotypes that allowed them to escape this limitation by attacking relatively healthy trees. These transitions were uncommon, and we suggest they were facilitated by (a) genetically and phenotypically flexible host selection behaviours, (b) biochemical adaptations for detoxifying a wide range of defence compounds, and (c) associations with symbionts, which together aided bark beetles in overcoming formidable constitutive and induced host defences. The ability to detoxify terpenes influenced the evolutionary course of pheromonal communication. Specifically, a mate attraction system, which was exploited by intraspecific competitors in locating poorly defended hosts, became a system of cooperative attack in which emitters benefit from the contributions responders make in overcoming defence. This functional shift in communication was driven in part by linkage of beetle semiochemistry to host defence chemistry. Behavioural and phenological adaptations also improved the beetles' abilities to detect when tree defences are impaired, and, where compatible with life history adaptations to other selective forces, for flight to coincide with seasonally predictable host stress agents. We propose a conceptual model, whereby the above mechanisms enable beetles to concentrate on those trees that offer an optimal trade-off between host defence and interspecific competition, along dynamic gradients of tree vigour and stand-level beetle density. We offer suggestions for future research on testing elements of this model.},

abstract = {Mapping persistently cloudy tropical landscapes with optical satellite imagery usually requires assembling the clear imagery from several dates. This study compares methods for normalizing image data when filling cloud gaps in Landsat imagery with imagery from other dates. Over a complex tropical island landscape, namely St. Kitts and Nevis and the island of St. Eustatius, all of the methods tested reduce interdate image differences for ETM+ bands 1-5 and 7, NDVI, and band 4:5 ratio. Regression tree normalization reduces the interdate differences more consistently than linear regression or histogram matching. Normalizing ETM+ images with regression trees can produce more seamless imagery than linear normalization, histogram matching, or image-based atmospheric correction via dark object subtraction. More seamless imagery enhances visual interpretation and helps reveal the distributions of forest formations in these landscapes. Decision tree classification of cloud-filled Landsat imagery can accurately map land cover and detailed forest formations. Decision tree classification accuracy is not highly dependent on the method used to make the cloud-filled imagery, however, at least as long as (i) classification model training data reflect class spectral variability, and (ii) ancillary spatial data that relate to the distributions of classes are used in the classification. Cloud-filled imagery is also known as cloud-cleared imagery. {\textcopyright} 2007 CASI.},

abstract = {Hierarchies and adaptive cycles comprise the basis of ecosystems and social-ecological systems across scales. Together they form a panarchy. The panar- chy describes how a healthy system can invent and experiment, benefiting from inventions that create opportunity while being kept safe from those that destabilize because of their nature or excessive ex- uberance. Each level is allowed to operate at its own pace, protected from above by slower, larger levels but invigorated from below by faster, smaller cycles of innovation. The whole panarchy is therefore both creative and conserving. The interactions be- tween cycles in a panarchy combine learning with continuity. An analysis of this process helps to clar- ify the meaning of "sustainable development." Sus- tainability is the capacity to create, test, and main- tain adaptive capability. Development is the process of creating, testing, and maintaining opportunity. The phrase that combines the two, "sustainable de- velopment," thus refers to the goal of fostering adaptive capabilities and creating opportunities. It is therefore not an oxymoron but a term that de- scribes a logical partnership},

abstract = {Despite the presence of mutations in APC or $\beta$-catenin, which are believed to activate the Wnt signalling cascade constitutively, most colorectal cancers show cellular heterogeneity when $\beta$-catenin localization is analysed, indicating a more complex regulation of Wnt signalling. We explored this heterogeneity with a Wnt reporter construct and observed that high Wnt activity functionally designates the colon cancer stem cell (CSC) population. In adenocarcinomas, high activity of the Wnt pathway is observed preferentially in tumour cells located close to stromal myofibroblasts, indicating that Wnt activity and cancer stemness may be regulated by extrinsic cues. In agreement with this notion, myofibroblast-secreted factors, specifically hepatocyte growth factor, activate $\beta$-catenin-dependent transcription and subsequently CSC clonogenicity. More significantly, myofibroblast-secreted factors also restore the CSC phenotype in more differentiated tumour cells both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore propose that stemness of colon cancer cells is in part orchestrated by the microenvironment and is a much more dynamic quality than previously expected that can be defined by high Wnt activity. The sequential events driving the transition of normal colonic mucosa to adenocarcinoma have been well documented and depend critically on alterations to Wnt signalling 1–4 . In normal cells the transcriptional regula-tor $\beta$-catenin is tightly controlled by a multiprotein complex that contains the tumour suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) 2 . Activation of Frizzled receptors by Wnt ligands disrupts this complex and results in the translocation of $\beta$-catenin to the nucleus, where it associates with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors to activate specific Wnt target genes 5,6 . Under physiological condi-tions, Wnt activity is crucial for intestinal stem cells and crypt homeosta-sis 7 . However, Wnt signalling also has a central function in pathological settings 2 . Mutation of APC or $\beta$-catenin is an early event in the transfor-mation of colonic epithelial cells, but established colorectal cancers also depend critically on Wnt signalling 8 . APC mutations generally result in a defective $\beta$-catenin degradation complex and, as a consequence, the accumulation of $\beta$-catenin in the nucleus and the perpetual transcrip-tion of Wnt target genes 9 . Although this would imply that all tumour cells contain active Wnt signalling, immunohistochemical studies have revealed that colon carcinomas harbouring APC mutations do not contain nuclear $\beta$-catenin homogeneously (Fig. 1a) 10,11 . This so-called $\beta$-catenin paradox is intriguing in the light of recent observations that indicate that only a subset of tumour cells, CSCs, are endowed with tumorigenic capacity 12 , whereas most tumour cells have undergone differentiation and lost their tumorigenic potential. CSCs have been identified by using several markers, such as CD133 and CD166 (refs 13–16). Because Wnt signalling is a domi-nant force preserving the normal fate of colon stem cells 2 , we proposed a preponderant role for this pathway in colon CSCs as well. Using a TCF/LEF reporter that directs the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (TOP–GFP) we provide evidence that Wnt signalling activity is a marker for colon CSCs and is regulated by the microenvironment. Moreover, we show that differentiated cancer cells, which have lost the capacity to form tumours and are no longer clono-genic, can be reprogrammed to express CSC markers and regain their tumorigenic capacity when stimulated with myofibroblast-derived fac-tors. This suggests that cancer stemness is not a rigid feature but can be modulated and even installed by the microenvironment.},

The numbers of I. typographus were high in all plots, whether the plots were characterized by long-term outbreaks or short-term outbreaks. The numbers of maternal galleries in the sample areas ranged from 300 to 400 per m2. The density of parental beetle galleries, abundance of surviving specimens of I. typographus, and length of maternal galleries did not differ between plots. The short-term outbreaks had only fewer ectoparasitoids of I. typographus and a lower percentage of parasitism and infection level of Mattesia schwenkei than the long-term outbreaks even though the maternal gallery densities and beetle production were the same. The most mortality appeared to be caused by intraspecific larval competition, and the identical reproductive success in plots with short-term and long-term outbreaks indicates that the negative feedback resulting from parasitoids and entomopathogens does not substantially reduce beetle numbers. Although entomopathogenic fungi as Beauveria bassiana occur naturally in the galleries of spruce bark beetles, there was no evidence of its presence in the studied population. The low levels of predation and/or parasitism in both kinds of plots indicate that natural enemies did not play a significant role in reducing outbreak numbers of I. typographus. {\textcopyright} 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

The ability to identify old-growth forests through remote sensing would be helpful for both conservation and forest management. We used data on beech, Norway spruce and mountain pine old-growth forests in the Ukrainian Carpathians to test whether Sentinel-2 satellite images could be used to correctly identify these forests. We used summer and autumn 2017 Sentinel-2 satellite images comprising 10 and 20 m resolution bands to create 6 vegetation indices and 9 textural features. We used a Random Forest classification model to discriminate between dominant tree species within old-growth forests and between old-growth and other forest types. Beech and Norway spruce were identified with an overall accuracy of around 90{\%}, with a lower performance for mountain pine (70{\%}) and mixed forest (40{\%}). Old-growth forests were identified with an overall classification accuracy of 85{\%}. Adding textural features, band standard deviations and elevation data improved accuracies by 3.3{\%}, 2.1{\%} and 1.8{\%} respectively, while using combined summer and autumn images increased accuracy by 1.2{\%}.

Four fast pansharpening methods—Fast Intensity-Hue-Saturation (FIHS), Brovey Transform (BT), Additive Wavelet Transform (AWT), and Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation (SFIM)—and two VIs—Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Simple Ratio (SR)—were tested. The NDVI and SR formulas were both found to cause some spatial information loss in the pansharpened multispectral (MS) bands, and this spatial information loss from VI transformations was not specific to Landsat 8 imagery (it will occur for any type of imagery). BT, SFIM, and other similar pansharpening methods that inject spatial information from the panchromatic (Pan) band by multiplication, lose all of the injected spatial information after the VI calculations. FIHS, AWT, and other similar pansharpening methods that inject spatial information by addition, lose some spatial information from the Pan band after VI calculations as well. Nevertheless, for all of the single- and multi-date VI images, the FIHS and AWT pansharpened images were more similar to the higher resolution reference data than the unsharpened VI images were, indicating that pansharpening was effective in downscaling the VI data. FIHS best enhanced the spectral and spatial information of the single-date and multi-date VI images, followed by AWT, and neither significantly over- or under-estimated VI values.},

abstract = {In Central Europe and North America, bark beetle infestations cause considerable economic losses. If infested trees are not rapidly removed, large areas can be damaged. Removal of infested trees has to be done during the so-called "green-attack" stage, which is before the bark beetles move to other trees. Field surveys even if they are feasible are cost intensive and impractical if large areas have to be monitored. The aim of the study was to analyse the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite imagery for detecting bark beetle infestations of two intensity stages (e.g. "dead" and "green-attack") against "healthy" (nonattacked) trees. For classifying individual trees two classifiers, random forest and logistic regression, were evaluated. Despite the relative large class overlap in the spectral signatures, the sample trees (n = 600) could be assigned to the classes "dead", "green-attack", and "healthy" with an overall accuracy of about 75{\%}. Producer's and user's accuracies of all classes were around 70{\%}. The best result was obtained with random forests using the eight spectral bands of a WorldView-2 image acquired in July. With this dataset, an overall accuracy of 76{\%} and a kappa coefficient of 0.61 were achieved. For the separation of the classes "healthy" and "greenattack", vegetation indices based on 2-band normalized differences as well as ratios yielded nearly as good results as the classification with all eight spectral bands. The best results were obtained by combining either the Green or Yellow band with the Near Infrared 1. With regard to individual bands, the Yellow and the Red band are defined as most important ones. We can conclude that 8-band WorldView-2 imagery has the potential for creating hotspot maps of infested trees or of trees with an increased risk of infestation. This could have positive implications for the forest practice.},

Here we show that large parts of Europe could be invaded by five detrimental alien pests already under current climate. Climate change increases the potential range of alien pests particularly in Northern and Eastern Europe. We estimate the live C at risk from a potential future invasion as 1027 Tg C (10{\%} of the European total), with a C recovery time of 34 years. We show that the impact of introduced pests could be as severe as the current natural disturbance regime in Europe, calling for increased efforts to halt the introduction and spread of invasive alien species.},

abstract = {Europe's forests were hit hard by storms in 1990 and 1999, which caused respectively 120 and 180 million m3 of damage (L{\"{a}}ssig and Sch{\"{o}}nenberger 2000, UNECE/FAO 2000b). Storms with so much impact on the forest have not been recorded in the past. Historians in France, however, claim that also in earlier times storms have hit the French forest badly (Doll and Riou-Nivert 1991). As a result of the storms, discussion arose why these storms caused so much damage and why there seems to be more frequent wind damage. Several experts draw a connection between changes in climate and an increase of storm intensity and frequency. Others see the increasing damage amount as part of the currently still dominating forest structure of monocultural and evenaged forests (M{\o}ller 1957, Lekes and Dandul 2000). In many European countries natural forests have been converted to evenaged monospecies plantations (see e.g. B{\"{o}}hm 1981). They are generally believed to be more vulnerable to windthrow and other damaging agents (Lekes and Dandul 2000). Also both the total forest area and the total standing volume has increased during the last century (Holmsgaard 1982, UN-ECE/FAO 2000c, P{\"{a}}ivinen et al. 1999), resulting in a larger resource that can be damaged. Some efforts were made to make an overview of the history of wind damage in Europe's forests (Avram 1983, Holmsgaard 1982), of which the study by Doll and Riou-Nivert (1991) was the most comprehensive. Such studies usually covered only large events, not being complete and usually with a focus on certain regions only. In the Mediterranean Basin fires are a regular phenomenon with in cases disastrous impacts on the landscape and the economy. Over the last decades, both the number and area of forest fires has increased (Schelhaas and Schuck 2002). Climate change could partly play a role, but human induced activities are of considerable importance. The UN-ECE and the FAO collect and report data on forest fires on a regular basis. The collection started in the early 1980's and resulted in two overviews, published in 1982 and 1984 (FAO 1982, FAO 1984). After a gap of more than a decade data collection was taken up. Since 1996 forest fire overviews are published regularly (UN- ECE/FAO 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000a, 2001).},

abstract = {More than a decade after its initial discovery in the Western Cape, the Eurasian woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, has spread to the southern parts of KwaZulu-Natal posing a serious threat to pine species in the region. Whilst foresters are able to provide broad scale assessments of S. noctilio infestation, there are no existing frameworks in place to provide quantifiable measurements of the spatial or temporal distributions of this damaging agent, and the impact it has on commercial pine forestry. Remote sensing technology offers an alternative to the current broad scale methods of assessing forest health. In this study, high resolution (50cm) imagery was acquired over commercial Pinus patula vegetation of varying age classes which had been ground assessed and ranked on an individual tree crown basis using a visual severity scale (i.e. healthy, green, red and grey). A series of ratio and linear based vegetation indices were calculated and compared to the different S.noctilio crown condition classes. Of the vegetation indices calculated, significant differences (p{\textless}0.001) between the pre-visual (healthy and green) and visual (red and grey) crown condition classes were obtained, using the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalised difference vegetation index (GNDVI). Canonical variate analysis further revealed that greater discriminatory power between the different S.noctilio crown condition classes is obtained when using NDVI as compared to the other vegetation indices. Overall the study demonstrated the importance of using vegetation indices obtained from high resolution airborne imagery to discriminate between healthy trees and trees that were in the visual stage of infestation (red and grey stages).},

abstract = {The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is one of the major insect pests of mature Norway spruce forests. In this study, a model describing the temperature-dependent thresholds for swarming activity and temperature requirement for development from egg to adult was driven by transient regional climate scenario data for Sweden, covering the period of 1961–2100 for three future climate change scenarios (SRES A2, A1B and B2). During the 20th century, the weather supported the production of one bark beetle generation per year, except in the north-western mountainous parts of Sweden where the climate conditions were too harsh. A warmer climate may sustain a viable population also in the mountainous part; however, the distributional range of I. typographus may be restricted by the migration speed of Norway spruce. Modelling suggests that an earlier timing of spring swarming and fulfilled development of the first generation will significantly increase the frequency of summer swarming. Model calculations suggest that the spruce bark beetle will be able to initiate a second generation in South Sweden during 50{\%} of the years around the mid century. By the end of the century, when temperatures during the bark beetle activity period are projected to have increased by 2.4–3.8 °C, a second generation will be initiated in South Sweden in 63–81{\%} of the years. The corresponding figures are 16–33{\%} for Mid Sweden, and 1–6{\%} for North Sweden. During the next decades, one to two generations per year are predicted in response to temperature, and the northern distribution limit for the second generation will vary. Our study addresses questions applicable to sustainable forest management, suggesting that adequate countermeasures require monitoring of regional differences in timing of swarming and development of I. typographus, and planning of control operations during summer periods with large populations of bark beetles.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Maintenance of ecological integrity and biodiversity must be based on well-grounded principles of disturbance ecology. However, non-equilibrium aspects of ecosystems, such as unpredictability, instability and stochasticity due to various natural disturbances, have not been satisfactorily integrated into practical application. Failure to acknowledge the dynamic nature of systems will inevitably lead to unexpected changes and unachieved conservation goals. 2. This review discusses non-equilibrium ecology in terms of natural disturbances and the conservation and management of terrestrial ecosystems and landscapes. 3. Several key components, which require further ecological consideration, are specifically discussed. These include the hierarchical disturbance regime, disturbance legacy, multiple post-disturbance pathways, climate instability, spatial and temporal variability, and resilience. 4. Natural disturbance regimes are complex and difficult to define. This is because some disturbances can be nested, and they interact with other qualitatively and quantitatively different disturbances, constituting a hierarchy of natural disturbances. Large temporal and spatial perspectives are therefore required to incorporate the hierarchical context of natural disturbance regimes into regional management plans. 5. Conservation managers may often seek some kind of dynamic equilibrium based on protection of species and seral stages from extinction. However, because climate instability interrupts any shift toward an equilibrium, most terrestrial vegetation systems are inherently prone to large environmental changes and diverse disturbances, and thus, are dynamic and non-equilibrating. 6. Synthesis and applications. Resiliency is the key to conserving ecological integrity via the ability to cope with inevitable changes. As long as ecosystems are resilient and disturbances are natural, we should not impede natural shifts in disturbance regimes and resultant ecosystem changes, even if changes are abrupt and unpredictable and thus have large consequences. If ecological resilience has already been eroded by humans, it is important that resilience should be enhanced by restoring keystone features of vegetation systems to prevent disturbance-induced undesirable ecosystem degradation.},

Simply reporting overall accuracy, however, does not provide sufficient context to evaluate the map product and may misconstrue the accuracy with which red attack damage is detected and mapped. Accuracy assessments are not difficult to undertake, nor should they be difficult to interpret. Several recommendations regarding accuracy assessment were made in the context of mountain pine beetle red attack detection and mapping: (1) ground surveys provide the best source of validation data for not attacked and red attack; however, air photos and helicopter geographical positioning system surveys are viable alternatives; (2) select validation samples that are spatially representative and that are independent from any calibration data used for the classification; (3) select at least 50-100 samples per class for validation. The more samples used, the greater the confidence in the accuracy estimates reported; (4) use equal sample sizes for both not attacked and red attack classes; (5) report the contents of the full error matrix, not just overall accuracy; and (6) report 95{\%} confidence intervals for both overall accuracy and the producer's accuracy for red attack.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Introduced insects and pathogens impact millions of acres of forested land in the United States each year, and large-scale monitoring efforts are essential for tracking the spread of outbreaks and quantifying the extent of damage. However, monitoring the impacts of defoliating insects presents a significant challenge due to the ephemeral nature of defoliation events. Using the 2016 gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) outbreak in Southern New England as a case study, we present a new approach for near-real-time defoliation monitoring using synthetic images produced from Landsat time series. By comparing predicted and observed images, we assessed changes in vegetation condition multiple times over the course of an outbreak. Initial measures can be made as imagery becomes available, and season-integrated products provide a wall-to-wall assessment of potential defoliation at 30 m resolution. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons suggest our Landsat Time Series (LTS) products improve identification of defoliation events relative to existing products and provide a repeatable metric of change in condition. Our synthetic-image approach is an important step toward using the full temporal potential of the Landsat archive for operational monitoring of forest health over large extents, and provides an important new tool for understanding spatial and temporal dynamics of insect defoliators.},

abstract = {The productivity and water consumption of forests depend on stand leaf area, which may vary with tree age, forest structure, and environment. How forest management affects leaf area and whether production forests have different leaf areas than unmanaged natural forests, is not clear. We compared the leaf area index (LAI) of production forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) with that of primeval forests (three forests in each case) in Slovakia and analyzed the LAI change from early to late stages of the natural forest development cycle. Optically determined LAI (LAI2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer) was on average 7.1 m2 m−2 (2.8–11.0 m2 m−2) in the primeval forests and 7.4 m2 m−2 (4.3–11.2 m2 m−2) in the production forests. Model results show that transforming beech primeval forests into even-aged production forests would reduce LAI by ∼1.6 units, if stem density is kept constant. Complex primeval forest canopies thus promote the formation of higher LAIs. However, this effect was compensated for by the higher stem densities of the production forests, resulting on average in similar LAIs of production and primeval forests. In the terminal stage of natural forest development with tree death and gap formation, plot-level LAI was not lower than in the earlier growth and optimal stages, probably because neighboring beech trees were rapidly filling gaps with foliage. This suggests that stand-level productivity is not reduced in the terminal stage of forest development, since LAI is rapidly restored after the death of individual trees. Our results provide insights into the functional role of structural complexity in temperate forest canopies and how European beech maintains dominance across the full forest development cycle.},

abstract = {Stand-replacing disturbance and post-disturbance salvage-logging influence forest succession in different ways; however, limited knowledge regarding how salvage-logging affects vegetation patterns compared to natural development of forest ecosystems is still lacking. In this study, we described the diversity pattern of understory vegetation and tree regeneration in mountain spruce forest of Tatra Mountains, northern Slovakia, where a high severity windstorm affecting over 10,000 ha occurred in 2004. The area was consequently subjected to salvage-logging. We asked how the species composition, vegetation diversity, and its spatial heterogeneity were modified by severe salvage-logging. Vascular plants, deadwood coverage, and tree species densities were monitored on non-intervention (NI; n = 108) and salvage-logged (SL; n = 95) experimental plots (spatially nested design, sample plot area 3.14 m2) six and seven years after disturbance, respectively. The NI sites were structurally more diverse with post-windstorms legacies such as deadwood and pit and mound topography being recorded. The NI plots contained more late-successional plant and moss species that are commonly found in the pre-disturbance forest. The NI plots were also more diverse in terms of alpha- and beta-diversity with abundant natural regeneration of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). The structure of SL site was more homogeneous and its species composition shifted towards being dominated by grasses, although the site accommodated a higher number of plant species due to newly established pioneer plant- and tree species. The retreat of late-successional species in favour of grasses can lead to structural and functional homogenization of habitat and to delayed succession towards establishment of spruce forest. We conclude that the removal of wind-disturbance legacies significantly diverts natural successional pathways. We recommend avoiding salvage-logging in protected areas since large-scale application of salvage-logging reduces beta-diversity of the landscape.},

abstract = {In July 2016, the European Commission (EC) published a legislative proposal for incorporating greenhouse gas emissions and removals due to Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) into its 2030 Climate and Energy Framework. The Climate and Energy Framework aims at a total emission reduction of 40{\%} by 2030 for all sectors together as part of the Paris Agreement. The LULUCF proposal regulates a “no debit” target for LULUCF (Forests and Agricultural soils), and regulates the accounting of any additional mitigation potential that might be expected of it. We find that the forest share of the LULUCF sector can achieve much more than what is in the regulation now. We elaborate a strategy for unlocking European Union (EU) forests and forest sector potential based on the concept of “climate smart forestry” (CSF). We find that to-date, European policy has not firmly integrated forest potential into the EU climate policy framework. Nor have climate objectives been firmly integrated into those of the forest and forest sector at either the EU or national level. Yet a wide range of measures can be applied to provide positive incentives for more firmly integrating these climate objectives into the forest and forest sector framework. With the right set of incentives in place at EU and Member States levels, we find the current literature supports the view that the EU has the potential to achieve an additional combined mitigation impact through CSF of 441 Mt CO2/year by 2050. In addition, CSF, through reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting and building forest resilience, and sustainably increasing forest productivity and incomes, tackles multiple policy goals.},

Here, we examine tree regeneration, surface fuels, understory plants, inorganic soil nitrogen and water infiltration in uncut and logged stands, outside and inside the fire perimeter. Subalpine fir recruitment was abundant in uncut, unburned, beetle-killed stands, whereas lodgepole pine recruitment was abundant in cut stands. Logging roughly doubled woody fuel cover and halved forb and shrub cover. Wildfire consumed all conifer seedlings in uncut and cut stands and did not stimulate new conifer regeneration within four years of the fire. Aspen regeneration, in contrast, was relatively unaffected by logging or burning, alone or combined. Wildfire also drastically reduced cover of soil organic horizons, fine woody fuels, graminoids and shrubs relative to unburned, uncut areas; moreover, the compound effect of logging and wildfire was generally similar to wildfire alone. This case study documents scarce conifer regeneration but ample aspen regeneration after a wildfire that occurred in the later stage of a severe beetle outbreak. Salvage logging had mixed effects on tree regeneration, understory plant and surface cover and soil nitrogen, but neither exacerbated nor ameliorated wildfire effects on those resources.},

Herein, we provide a review of the spread and distribution of this tree and timber pest species across Europe, before and after 2000, along with a review of its habitat preferences. Since the spread of X. germanus across Europe has accelerated rapidly post-2000, emphasis is placed on this period. X. germanus was first recorded in Germany in 1951 and since then in 21 other European countries along with Russia. Ethanol-baited traps were deployed in oak, beech, and spruce forest ecosystems in the Western Carpathians, Central Europe, Slovakia, to characterize the distribution and habitat preferences of this non-native ambrosia beetle. Captures of X. germanus within Slovakia have been rising rapidly since its first record in 2010, and now this species dominates captures of ambrosia beetles. X. germanus has spread throughout Slovakia from south-southwest to north-northeast over a period of 5–10 years, and has also spread vertically into higher altitudes within the country. While living but weakened trees in Europe and North America are attacked by X. germanus, the greatest negative impact within Slovakia is attacks on recently felled logs of oak, beech and spruce trees, which provide high quality timber/lumber. We suggest that the recent rapid spread of X. germanus in Central Europe is being facilitated by environmental changes, specifically global warming, and the increasing frequency of timber trade. Recommendations for the management of X. germanus in forest ecosystems are proposed and discussed, including early detection, monitoring, sanitary measures, etc.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Much has been learned about the causes and consequences of crown fires from studies of the Yellowstone fires, and some results were surprising. Plant cover in burned areas was restored rapidly by native species, making post-fire rehabilitation generally unnecessary and possibly even counterproductive. While 20th-century fire suppression has affected systems like Yellowstone far less than other ecosystems, managing forests, people, and property in wildfire areas is an ongoing challenge.

abstract = {Climate change is expected to drive the distribution retraction of northern spe-cies. However, particularly in regions with a history of intensive exploitation, changes in habi-tat management could facilitate distribution expansions counter to expectations under climate change. Here, we test the potential for future forest management to facilitate the southward expansion of an old-forest species from the boreal region into the boreo-nemoral region, con-trary to expectations under climate change. We used an ensemble of species distribution mod-els based on citizen science data to project the response of Phellinus ferrugineofuscus, a red-listed old-growth indicator, wood-decaying fungus, to six forest management and climate change scenarios. We projected change in habitat suitability across the boreal and boreo-nemoral regions of Sweden for the period 2020–2100. Scenarios varied in the proportion of forest set aside from production, the level of timber extraction, and the magnitude of climate change. Habitat suitabilities for the study species were projected to show larger relative increases over time in the boreo-nemoral region compared to the boreal region, under all sce-narios. By 2100, mean suitabilities in set-aside forest in the boreo-nemoral region were similar to the suitabilities projected for set-aside forest in the boreal region in 2020, suggesting that occurrence in the boreo-nemoral region could be increased. However, across all scenarios, con-sistently higher projected suitabilities in set-aside forest in the boreal region indicated that the boreal region remained the species stronghold. Furthermore, negative effects of climate change were evident in the boreal region, and projections suggested that climatic changes may eventu-ally counteract the positive effects of forest management in the boreo-nemoral region. Our results suggest that the current rarity of this old-growth indicator species in the boreo-nemoral region may be due to the history of intensive forestry. Forest management therefore has the potential to compensate for the negative effects of climate change. However, increased occur-rence at the southern range edge would depend on the dispersal and colonization ability of the species. An increase in the amount of set-aside forest across both the boreal and boreo-nemoral regions is therefore likely to be required to prevent the decline of old-forest species under climate change.},

abstract = {Information on the changing land surface is required at high spatial resolutions as many processes cannot be resolved using coarse resolution data. Deriving such information over large areas for Landsat data, however, still faces numerous challenges. Image compositing offers great potential to circumvent such shortcomings. We here present a compositing algorithm that facilitates creating cloud free, seasonally and radiometrically consistent datasets from the Landsat archive. A parametric weighting scheme allows for flexibly utilizing different pixel characteristics for optimized compositing. We describe in detail the development of three parameter decision functions: acquisition year, day of year and distance to clouds. Our test site covers 42 Landsat footprints in Eastern Europe and we produced three annual composites. We evaluated seasonal and annual consistency and compared our composites to BRDF normalized MODIS reflectance products. Finally, we also evaluated how well the composites work for land cover mapping. Results prove that our algorithm allows for creating seasonally consistent large area composites. Radiometric correspondence to MODIS was high (up to {\textless}formula formulatype="inline"{\textgreater}{\textless}tex Notation="TeX"{\textgreater}{\$}{\{}rm R{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\textgreater}0.8{\$}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}{\textless}/formula{\textgreater}), but varied with land cover configuration and selected image acquisition dates. Land cover mapping yielded promising results (overall accuracy 72{\%}). Class delineations were regionally consistent with minimal effort for training data. Class specific accuracies increased considerably ({\textless}formula formulatype="inline"{\textgreater}{\textless}tex Notation="TeX"{\textgreater}{\$}sim{\$}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}{\textless}/formula{\textgreater}10{\%}) when spectral metrics were incorporated.

abstract = {High spatial resolution images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been shown to have the potential for monitoring agronomic and environmental variables. However, it is necessary to capture a large number of overlapped images that must be mosaicked together to produce a single and accurate ortho-image (also called an ortho-mosaicked image) representing the entire area of work. Thus, ground control points (GCPs) must be acquired to ensure the accuracy of the mosaicking process. UAV ortho-mosaics are becoming an important tool for early site-specific weed management (ESSWM), as the discrimination of small plants (crop and weeds) at early growth stages is subject to serious limitations using other types of remote platforms with coarse spatial resolutions, such as satellite or conventional aerial platforms. Small changes in flight altitude are crucial for low-altitude image acquisition because these variations can cause important differences in the spatial resolution of the ortho-images. Furthermore, a decrease of flying altitude reduces the area covered by each single overlapped image, which implies an increase of both the sequence of images and the complexity of the image mosaicking procedure to obtain an ortho-image covering the whole study area. This study was carried out in two wheat fields naturally infested by broad-leaved and grass weeds at a very early pheno-logical stage. The geometric accuracy differences and crop line alignment among ortho-mosaics created from UAV image series were investigated while taking into account three different flight altitudes (30, 60 and 100 m) and a number of GCPs (from 11 to 45). The results did not show relevant differences in geo-referencing accuracy on the interval of altitudes studied. Similarly, the increase of the number of GCPs did not imply a relevant increase of geo-referencing accuracy. Therefore, the most important parameter to consider when choosing the flying altitude is the ortho-image spatial resolution required rather than the geo-referencing accuracy. Regarding the crop mis-alignment, the results showed that the overall errors were less than twice the spatial resolution, which did not break the crop line continuity at the studied spatial resolutions (pixels from 7.4 to 24.7 mm for 30, 60 and 100 m flying altitudes respectively) on the studied crop (early wheat). The results lead to the conclusion that a UAV flying at a range of 30 to 100 m altitude and using a moderate number of GCPs is able to generate ultra-high spatial resolution ortho-imagesortho-images with the geo-referencing accuracy required to map small weeds in wheat at a very early phenological stage. This is an ambitious agronomic objective that is being studied in a wide research program whose global aim is to create broad-leaved and grass weed maps in wheat crops for an effective ESSWM.},

abstract = {During the last more than twenty years, various types of forest disturbance (i.e. insect outbreak, clear-cutting) occurred in the central part of the {\v{S}}umava Mountains. The bark beetle (Ips typographus [L]) outbreak in this region resulted in regional-scale spruce forest decay. Clear-cutting was done here to prevent further bark-beetle propagation in the buffer zones. Dynamics of the disturbance types has been analyzed by processing 15 satellite Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes from the years 1985, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Supervised classification (Maximum Likelihood) was used to identify deforested areas. Classification proved that main forest disturbance in the Central Sumava Mountains occurred between 1995 and 1998, when the dispersion of the spruce bark beetle in forest stands accelerated. Total area of decayed spruce forests due to bark beetle during the whole period was estimated at 1763 ha, out of it 1013 ha in the Bavarian Forest NP 749 ha in the {\v{S}}umava NP. Total clear-cut areas reached more than 387 ha in the {\v{S}}umava NP, whereas they only reached a total of 13 ha in the Bavarian Forest NP. Compared to published data, the results for both disturbance types are lower as they did not include the area to the east of the peak Luzn{\'{y}}. The final disturbance model shows progress and dynamics of spruce bark beetle spreading in both national parks as well as the development of forest losses due to clear-cutting mainly in the {\v{S}}umava NP.},

abstract = {The individual-based (aka agent-based) approach is now well established in ecological modeling. Traditionally, most applications have been to organisms at higher trophic levels, where the importance of population heterogeneity (intra-population variability), complete life cycles and behavior adapted to internal and external conditions has been recognized for some time. However, advances in molecular biology and biochemistry have brought about an increase in the application of individual-based modeling (IBM) to microbes as well. This literature review summarizes 46 IBM papers for bacteria in wastewater treatment plants, phytoplankton in ocean and inland waters, bacteria in biofilms, bacteria in food and other environs, and "digital organisms" and "domesticated computer viruses" in silico. The use of IBM in these applications was motivated by population heterogeneity (45{\%}), emergence (24{\%}), absence of a continuum (5{\%}), and other unknown reasons (26{\%}). In general, the challenges and concepts of IBM modeling for microbes and higher trophic levels are similar. However, there are differences in the microbe population dynamics and their environment that create somewhat different challenges, which have led to somewhat different modeling concepts. Several topics are discussed, including producing, maintaining and changing population heterogeneity (different life histories, internal variability, positive feedback, inter-generation memory), dealing with very large numbers of individuals (different up-scaling methods, including representative space vs. super-individual, number vs. biomass based, discrete vs. continuous kinetics, various agent accounting methods), handling space, simulating interactions with the extracellular environment (hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach), modeling agent-agent interaction (self-shading, predation, shoving) and passive transport (random walk with spatially variable diffusivity, well-mixed reactors). Overall, the literature indicates that the application of IBM to microbes is developing into a mature field. However, several challenges remain, including simulating various types of agent-agent interactions (formation and function of colonies or filaments, sexual reproduction) and even smaller individuals (viruses, genes). Further increases in intracellular detail and complexity in microbe IBMs may be considered the combination of systems biology and systems ecology, or the new field of systems bioecology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mixed-species forests can sometimes fulfil forest functions and services better than monocultures and are therefore receiving growing attention in forest science and practice. The productivity of mixtures and the interactions between species are influenced by the availability of different resources and climatic conditions, all of which change spatially and temporally. Models are a valuable tool for understanding and predicting how these interacting factors will influence the growth and other functions and services in mixed-species forests. However, concepts, models and theory are still mainly based on monocultures, which have dominated forest science since its beginnings. Recent empirical works report strong effects of mixing tree species on the environmental conditions within stands (e.g., vertical light profile, rooting space, humus layer), their functioning (e.g., photosynthetic rate, light use, growth), and tree and stand structure (e.g., crown and stem shape, shoot and root morphology). Process-based organ- or tree-level approaches reveal changed resource supply, flows and metabolic rates in high spatial and temporal resolution. Stand-level approaches usually provide predictions with a lower spatial and temporal resolution but can be more accurate in the longer-term. Many studies stress considerable effects of mixing tree species on growth dynamics, yield, resilience and stability, but these effects are still under-represented in existing models. We reviewed 54 forest growth models to show how they incorporate the variability of individual tree or species characteristics that occur in forests and how this variability influences the development and characteristics of the whole stand. While some organ- or tree-level models inherently integrate evident processes, stand-level models do not usually explicitly consider species interactions. Nevertheless, many processes that occur in mixtures can also be modelled at the stand level and are often included in stand-level monospecific models. Stand-level models are likely to offer a simpler alternative model structure for mixtures. We stress how both model approaches can be refined, benefit from mutual adjustment, and can be substantiated by further empirical research into mixed-species forests.},

abstract = {The Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) is a major forest pest at epidemic densities, capable of killing entire stands of mature pine. There are a variety of tactics used by forest managers to control MPB epidemics, but the ecology of the insect and the large scale of MPB infestations make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of any management strategy. Using a partial differential equation framework, we develop a mathematical model describing the interactions between beetles, beetle pheromone, and susceptible trees across multiple years. We use our mathematical model to examine the effectiveness of various existing management approaches used to limit the spread of the MPB. In particular, our study focuses on management activities that were used in Banff National Park, in Alberta, Canada. Comparing the indirect controls of prescribed burning and clearcutting, we found the success of these methods is critically dependent on the level of MPB attraction to, and productivity in, partially burned trees. Our analysis also indicates that pheromone baiting in combination with tree removal is successful at reducing MPB impact at high beetle densities, but may lead to greater forest impact and greater MPB population growth at low beetle densities. Finally, we found that removal of beetle-attacked trees in the absence of baiting is the most successful strategy if managers are able to locate areas with significant MPB activity.},

abstract = {Severe storm damage has been a recurring problem to the Swedish forestry sector since, at least, the start of the19th century. This short communication presents a regionally resolved time-series of storm damage in Swedish forests during the last century. Data on storm damage have been gathered from the National Board of Forestry, the Regional Forestry Boards and scientific reports.Storm damage in Swedish forests seems to have increased during the century with a peak around the 1980s. In total 110 million m 3 forest were destroyed by 77 recorded wind storms, with the severe storms in 1954 and 1969 accounting for 49{\%} of the total damage. Reported damage in southern Sweden was normalised against the area of productive forest with trees older than 40 years, for inter annual comparisons. The geostrophic wind was used to describe the regional wind direction during the storm events. Most damage occurred during NNW to SW winds, and by winds from NNE. Apart from a possible shift in storm intensity and frequency, the increase in storm damaged trees can be attributed to changes in regeneration and thinning regimes, variations in storm damage reporting system, increase in forest cover and various damage to root architecture. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The likely environmental changes throughout the next century have the potential to strongly alter forest disturbance regimes which may heavily affect forest functions as well as forest management. Forest stands already poorly adapted to current environmental conditions, such as secondary Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests outside their natural range, are expected to be particularly prone to such risks. By means of a simulation study, a secondary Norway spruce forest management unit in Austria was studied under conditions of climatic change with regard to effects of bark beetle disturbance on timber production and carbon sequestration over a time period of 100 years. The modified patch model PICUS v1.41, including a submodule of bark beetle-induced tree mortality, was employed to assess four alternative management strategies: (a) Norway spruce age-class forestry, (b) Norway spruce continuous cover forestry, (c) conversion to mixed species stands, and (d) no management. Two sets of simulations were investigated, one without the consideration of biotic disturbances, the other including possible bark beetle damages. Simulations were conducted for a de-trended baseline climate (1961-1990) as well as for two transient climate change scenarios featuring a distinct increase in temperature. The main objectives were to: (i) estimate the effects of bark beetle damage on timber production and carbon (C) sequestration under climate change; (ii) assess the effects of disregarding bark beetle disturbance in the analysis. Results indicated a strong increase in bark beetle damage under climate change scenarios (up to +219{\%} in terms of timber volume losses) compared to the baseline climate scenario. Furthermore, distinct differences were revealed between the studied management strategies, pointing at considerably lower amounts of salvage in the conversion strategy. In terms of C storage, increased biotic disturbances under climate change reduced C storage in the actively managed strategies (up to -41.0 tC ha-1) over the 100-year simulation period, whereas in the unmanaged control variant some scenarios even resulted in increased C sequestration due to a stand density effect. Comparing the simulation series with and without bark beetle disturbances the main findings were: (i) forest C storage was higher in all actively managed strategies under climate change, when biotic disturbances were disregarded (up to +31.6 tC ha-1 over 100 years); and (ii) in the undisturbed, unmanaged variant C sequestration was lower compared to the simulations with bark beetle disturbance (up to -69.9 tC ha-1 over 100 years). The study highlights the importance of including the full range of ecosystem-specific disturbances by isolating the effect of one important agent on timber production and C sequestration. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The clear cuts and seedling stands can speed up winds and may trigger blowdown at the edges of neighbour stands. Therefore, the height contrast of the neighbour stands and fragmentation at landscape level could be used to indicate the susceptibility of windthrow. In this study, we studied how forest fragmentation affects the susceptibility of a boreal forest ecosystem to wind damage, both at patch and landscape level based on theoretical computations. For this purpose we generated, based on real stand inventory data of a Finnish forest ecosystem, different landscape configurations of Scots pine and Norway spruce forests using Monte Carlo simulation. Thereafter, we applied a mechanistic wind damage model to predict the wind speeds needed for wind damage at forest edges. The fragmentation metrics of Contrast-Weighted Edge Density with three different height dissimilarity calculation methods were used to analyze the fragmentation at the landscape level. At the patch (stand) level, susceptibility of downwind stand to wind damage could be expressed in terms of a quadratic function, based on the tree height of upwind neighbouring stand or the height ratio between the neighbouring stands. At the landscape level, the relative risk of wind damage correlated linearly with the fragmentation despite of fragmentation metrics used. Both in single species and mixed forests, the metrics using empirical regression function based on patch level results (DS3) seemed more applicable in general than those using the ratio of tree heights between neighbouring stands (DS1) or constrained height contrast (DS2). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The combination of forest inventory and satellite-derived landscape composition and structure provides otherwise unavailable information on regional forest conditions and enables investigation of the cumulative effects of forest management over time. Forest pattern results from a range of both natural and anthropogenic factors. This study characterizes the forest pattern of Vancouver Island, British Columbia ({\textgreater}32,000 km2) at the watershed scale, using new national datasets of Canadian forest composition and fragmentation, and relating these to forest inventory-derived age structure. Vancouver Island is extensively forested, possessing highly valuable and productive forests, and is managed to meet a range of stakeholder interests. Forest fragmentation metrics were derived from a satellite-derived, 25-m spatial resolution land cover map (i.e., grain) to represent patterns within 1 km analysis units (i.e., extent) for the entire forested area of Canada. We summarized forest fragmentation island-wide and compared trends between forest-dominated ({\textgreater}85{\%} forest) and less-forested ({\textless}85{\%} forest) watersheds. We also explored these patterns with partial canonical correspondence analyses to determine the independent and shared relationships of landscape composition, forest fragmentation, and spatial variables with forest age structure. Less-forested watersheds are more fragmented than forest-dominated watersheds, as indicated by more (5.6 versus 2.7 per km2) and smaller (36 versus 63 ha) forest patches, and a greater edge density (82 versus 55 m/ha). Of the 1283 watersheds examined, 91{\%} were forest-dominated; island-wide trends are thus similar to those of the forest-dominated watersheds. Forest age is related to landscape composition and forest fragmentation, which collectively explain 27{\%} and 53{\%} of the age structure of all and less-forested watersheds, respectively. In both sets of watersheds, young forest stands (1-120 years) are associated with broadleaf forests, agreeing with successional expectations, and patchy forest distributions. For all watersheds, old growth forest stands ({\textgreater}240 years) are associated with dense coniferous forest, but also with early successional communities, smaller patch sizes, and greater edge densities, indicating fragmentation of these forests and reflecting strategies for managing old growth on the landscape. In contrast, watersheds with an abundance of mature forest (121-240 years) are compositionally similar to watersheds with old growth, but are much less fragmented. Our results indicate that although old growth forest stands on Vancouver Island have been retained, they are not typically found within a continuous forest matrix. Medium spatial resolution Earth observation products are now available for the entire forested area of Canada, providing valuable insight into spatial and temporal forest dynamics (i.e., succession, harvesting).

abstract = {The dynamics of a recent outbreak of the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) in Switzerland was ruled by a devastating winter storm in 1999 and the drought and heat of the summer 2003. Starting from a similar level of population sizes, estimated as the rate of infested growing stock, beetle populations increased differently in magnitude and time among different regions in Switzerland. Accordingly, we expected local or regional genetic differentiation as a result of such repeated population expansion/breakdown dynamics. We analyzed 5 nuclear microsatellites of spruce bark beetles sampled from pheromone traps at 30 locations distributed over Switzerland. Our genetic results did not indicate any sign of population differentiation, structure, isolation by distance, or recent bottlenecks. This complete lack of genetic structure suggests that spruce bark beetles are highly mobile, precluding the formation of a spatial structure at neutral molecular markers. Thus, this molecular-genetic approach does not allow us to discriminate among regional gene pools and to identify the origin of expanding beetle populations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {By allowing the estimation of forest structural and biophysical characteristics at different temporal and spatial scales, remote sensing may contribute to our understanding and monitoring of planted forests. Here, we studied 9-year time-series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on a network of 16 stands in fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations in S{\~{a}}o Paulo State, Brazil. We aimed to examine the relationships between NDVI time-series spanning entire rotations and stand structural characteristics (volume, dominant height, mean annual increment) in these simple forest ecosystems. Our second objective was to examine spatial and temporal variations of light use efficiency for wood production, by comparing time-series of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR) with inventory data. Relationships were calibrated between the NDVI and the fractions of intercepted diffuse and direct radiation, using hemispherical photographs taken on the studied stands at two seasons. APAR was calculated from the NDVI time-series using these relationships. Stem volume and dominant height were strongly correlated with summed NDVI values between planting date and inventory date. Stand productivity was correlated with mean NDVI values. APAR during the first 2 years of growth was variable between stands and was well correlated with stem wood production (r2 = 0.78). In contrast, APAR during the following years was less variable and not significantly correlated with stem biomass increments. Production of wood per unit of absorbed light varied with stand age and with site index. In our study, a better site index was accompanied both by increased APAR during the first 2 years of growth and by higher light use efficiency for stem wood production during the whole rotation. Implications for simple process-based modelling are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Forestry around the world has been experiencing a paradigm shift towards more nature-oriented forest management leading foresters to emulate natural disturbances by their silvicultural treatments. Important characteristics of all disturbances are their size, severity, temporal and spatial distribution. This study focuses on the spatial distribution of gaps in the forest canopy which are typically caused by small-scale, low intensity disturbances. The considerable spatial extent and irregular shape of canopy gaps are obvious obstacles to the application of classical point pattern analysis. The approximation of objects by their centroids does not lead to reasonable results, since the objects are at the same scale as the expected effects. By dividing the study area in grid cells and analysing all cells covered by an object, the size and the shape of the objects is accounted for. Nevertheless, both methods show undesirable effects. Thus we propose a new approach using the boundary polygons of the objects and construct the adapted pair-correlation function from the shortest distances between polygons. The adapted pair-correlation function is presented using simulated data and mapped canopy gaps of a near natural forest reserve. The results of our proposed method are compared to the grid-based approach and the classical point pattern analysis. The presented method provides meaningful results and even reveals the relationship of objects at short distances, which is not possible using the classical point pattern analysis or the grid-based approach. With regard to the analysis of the spatial distribution of canopy gaps, the adapted pair-correlation function proves to be a useful analytical tool. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships of P. abies (Norway spruce) seedling (height {\textless}15. cm) and sapling (height ≥15. cm) densities on decaying logs in relation to stage of wood decay, log diameter, ground contact of decaying log, assumed cause of tree death, presence of species of wood-decaying fungi and coverage by surrounding plants in the subalpine old-growth forests of the Bohemian Forest and Ash Mountains, in the Czech Republic. We have focused on how logs with different origin differ in their properties and how these properties influence seedling abundance. Seedling densities peaked on the medium-decayed logs and decreased thereafter. Sapling densities continually increased as the decay progressed. Seedling and sapling densities followed negative binomial distributions, with many logs of all decay stages having low regeneration densities. The degree of ground contact, white-rot-causing Armillaria spp. presence, white-rot-causing Phellinus nigrolimitatus presence and log diameter were positively related to both seedling and sapling density. Also tree death as a result of wind uprooting was positively related to sapling density. Conversely, the presence of brown-rot-causing Fomitopsis pinicola and tree death as a result of bark beetle attack were negatively related to regeneration densities. The low cover of vegetation from sides positively affected seedling density; however, heavily covered logs were less occupied by seedlings. Our study provides evidence that large logs originating from wind uprooting or butt rot infection are most appropriate for retention to promote natural spruce regeneration in managed subalpine spruce forests. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Phenology models play an important role in insect ecology and pest management. For bark beetle species prone to frequent outbreaks, they help predict swarming periods, discern sister generations hard to recognize in the field yet indispensable in studies of bark beetle population dynamics, predict the extent to which the generations entering diapause develop, as well as help address the omnipresent issue of impacts of climate change. As a prerequisite to developing a simulation model of landscape-level forest disturbances in the Bohemian Forest, including those due to Ips typographus, we validate the phenology model PHENIPS, published in the literature and simulating seasonal development of this species, by data coming from this region. We find a reasonable agreement between the modeled and actually observed bark beetle dynamics, thus strengthening the potential role of PHENIPS in any future attempt to model dynamics of Central European populations of I. typographus. In addition, we use PHENIPS to assess impacts of climate change on temperature-regulated phenology of I. typographus. In contrast to previous studies which used regional climate models to predict future temperature development, we independently account for changes in the mean air temperature and in the frequency of extreme weather events - for the latter, we assume that the inter-annual air temperature variance will also increase. Since bark beetle development is driven by bark temperatures and both low and high bark temperatures inhibit the development, we find that the effects of increases in the air temperature mean and variance are compensatory. Hence, if climate is to change so that both these characteristics grow, we expect only a relatively minor change in generation development time. Moreover, initiation of the third filial generation of I. typographus in the Bohemian Forest is predicted to occur only for relatively large shifts in the mean air temperature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Stand-level spatial pattern influences key aspects of resilience and ecosystem function such as disturbance behavior, regeneration, snow retention, and habitat quality in frequent-fire pine and mixed-conifer forests. Reference sites, from both pre-settlement era reconstructions and contemporary forests with active fire regimes, indicate that frequent-fire forests are complex mosaics of individual trees, tree clumps, and openings. There is a broad scientific consensus that restoration treatments should seek to restore this mosaic pattern in order to restore resilience and maintain ecosystem function. Yet, methods to explicitly incorporate spatial reference information into restoration treatments are not widely used. In addition, targets from reference conditions must be critically evaluated in light of climate change. We used a spatial clump identification algorithm to quantify reference patterns based on a specified inter-tree distance that defines when trees form clumps. We used climatic water balance parameters, downscaled climate projections, and plant associations to assess our historical reference sites in the context of projected future climate and identify climate analog reference conditions. Spatial reference information was incorporated into a novel approach to prescription development, tree marking, and monitoring based on viewing stand structure and pattern in terms of individuals, clumps, and openings (ICO) in a mixed-conifer forest restoration case study. We compared the results from the ICO approach with simulations of traditional basal area and spacing-based thinning prescriptions in terms of agreement with reference conditions and functional aspects of resilience. The ICO method resulted in a distribution of tree clumps and openings within the range of reference patterns, while the basal area and spacing approaches resulted in uniform patterns inconsistent with known reference conditions. Susceptibility to insect mortality was lower in basal area and spacing prescriptions, but openings and corresponding opportunities for regeneration and in situ climate adaptation were fewer. Operationally, the method struck a balance between providing clear targets for spatial pattern directly linked to reference conditions, sufficient flexibility to achieve other restoration objectives, and implementation efficiency. The need to track pattern targets during implementation and provide immediate feedback to marking crews was a key lesson. The ICO method, especially when used in combination with climate analog reference targets, offers a practical approach to restoring spatial patterns that are likely to enhance resilience and climate adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Bark beetle outbreaks have increased in Europe and North America. To mitigate damage efficiently during outbreaks, robust models predicting where the risk for tree mortality is highest across forest landscapes and better understanding of the underlying mechanisms are required.Using Boosted Regression Trees, we modelled relative risks of infestation by the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) across a 130,000. ha managed lowland forest landscape in southern Sweden during three years of an outbreak and at a resolution of 100. ×. 100. m. A second nearby landscape of similar size was used for validation. Both predictors reflecting forest susceptibility and beetle pressure were used. Forest susceptibility predictors included volume per ha of host and non-host trees, tree height and distance to the nearest clear-cut harvested during the last four years, all based on interpretations of satellite images. Bark beetle predictors were based on locations and sizes of previous year infestation spots recorded by helicopter.Model outcomes were similar across years, and there was no major reduction in performance when extrapolating predictions in space or time, indicating the modelled relationships have high reliability. Area under curve (AUC) values varied from 0.729 to 0.818. Including bark beetle predictors increased the AUC value somewhat in one of two years.The most important predictor was volume per ha of the host tree, Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) Karst., which reflects the probability of bark beetles encountering suitable trees. This variable was strongly positively correlated with risk up to 200m3ha-1. Unexpectedly, the volume of the non-host birch was also positively correlated with infestation risk up to 25m3ha-1. Tree height was associated with increased infestation risk above heights of 10m in 2008 and 15m in 2009. In 2007 and 2008 there was a weak negative relationship between infestation risk and distance to the nearest clear-cut. Additionally, our study shows that in managed forest landscapes the I. typographus-killed trees are distributed in many small infestation spots spread out over the landscape.We demonstrate that high-resolution risk-rating maps can be successfully created for large landscapes using easily accessible satellite data of forest characteristics and aerial surveys of infestation spots. The distribution of killed trees in many small infestation spots, poses a challenge for the forest owners to find and remove colonized trees before the new generation emerge. Our results suggest that mitigation efforts in managed lowland forest should focus on high volume spruce stands. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Bark beetles are among the main biotic hazards affecting forests worldwide. Aerial surveys are an appropriate and commonly used tool for detecting and monitoring bark beetle infestations at the landscape scale. However, a considerable time-lag in the aerial-surveyed data limits its use, e.g. for analyses which include temporary factors.This temporal lag is caused by the gradual decay of the host tree following a bark beetle attack. A change in the spectral signature in aerial imagery indicates an attack with a delay of several weeks or even months. Thus, aerial-surveyed infestation data suffer a temporal shift, i.e. infestations detected for a specific time period cannot be directly assumed to have been initiated within that same period. The present study introduces an algorithm which assigns the most probable time of Ips typographus L. attack to infestations detected by aerial surveys. To calculate the infestations initiated within a certain year x the algorithm considers the potential attack period, the assumed time-lag, as well as the date of aerial surveys and the amount of detected infestation from the years x, x-. 1 and x+. 1. The deviation between infestations detected by aerial survey and those actually initiated (as calculated by the algorithm) quantifies the correction effect, i.e. the time-lag bias. The algorithm was then applied to a data set which covers a time series of 26 consecutive years, including both managed and non-managed infestations. To account for uncertainty in the input variables or to mimic varying environments the application considers three different scenarios. Over all three scenarios results indicate substantial deviations, which may be either positive or negative. Further, deviation is shown to be affected by the length of the time-lag and the attack period, as well as by variations in survey dates and infestation frequency of consecutive years. Finally, the time-corrected infestation data provides a threefold benefit: (i) The temporal pattern of oscillating population dynamics is truly reflected. (ii) Comprehensive correlation analyses which include dynamic environmental covariates, e.g. temperature, precipitation, or antagonists, are facilitated. (iii) Aerial-surveyed and ground-surveyed monitoring data can be easily related whether within a region or between regions. In conclusion, this study increases the value of aerial-surveyed infestation data for bark beetle monitoring and research. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Bark beetles are the major biotic disturbance factor threatening Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] karst.) forests in Austria. The increase of bark beetle salvage after large storm damages is well known. However, over the recent two decades salvage from bark beetle damages in Austria has increased and varied between 0.6 and 3.0millionm3, where at regional scale a complex interplay of initial beetle population density, forest conditions, weather phenomena such as drought periods, various other disturbance agents such as snow and storm and forest management have been hypothesized as major determinants. This points at the need to develop tools to assess the risks of damage from bark beetle disturbances at the operational scale of forest stands, so that adaptation measures can be developed and implemented in a targeted approach. In the current analysis, binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to assess the effects of site, stand and climate conditions on the probability, and linear mixed models (LMMs) for the intensity of bark beetle disturbance events at forest stand level. The database used for model development combined 10-year forest management plans and related harvest records of four management units of the Austrian Federal Forests covering in total more than 40,000ha of forest, and a gridded climate data set provided by the Austrian Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics. In the models, timber stock volume and previous disturbances had the largest impacts on bark beetle damage. Potential bark beetle generations estimated from a beetle phenology model were also a useful predictor. While the model of disturbance probability correctly classified 90{\%} of all cases in the data set (specificity 95{\%}, sensitivity 29{\%}), the model for damage intensity explained only low shares of the variation in the recorded damage data (full model R2=0.45, fixed-effects-only model R2=0.13; cross validation in the four forest management units yielded similar R2 values). Benefits and limitations of the data set are critically discussed and conclusions for operational forest management are drawn. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Severe natural disturbances are common in many forest ecosystems, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Attempts to minimize their effects through forest management include salvage logging. In the Bohemian Forest, one of Central Europe's largest continuous forests, windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks have affected stands of Norway Spruce for centuries. Over the past decades, these natural disturbances and their management in the Bavarian Forest National Park and the adjacent {\v{S}}umava National Park in the central part of the Bohemian Forest have been scientifically studied. Owing to a benign-neglect strategy, both windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks have increased stand structural heterogeneity, the amount of dead wood and light availability, which contribute to increased populations of nearly-extinct forest specialists. However, the response of a particular taxonomic group or species strongly depends on its relationship to specific legacies that persist after disturbances. Stand climate but not dead wood appears to greatly influence the diversity of epigeal bryophytes, whereas both factors determine the diversity of epixylic bryophytes. Both the amount and heterogeneity of dead wood seems to be more important than stand climate in determining assemblages of wood-inhabiting fungi and lichens. To reduce the population density of bark beetles in the management zones of both national parks, storm-felled spruces are salvage logged, which alters a variety of these legacies and natural successional pathways. Consequently, the numbers of species of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles and epixylic lichens are reduced. Natural levels of biodiversity in salvage-logged areas can be preserved by (1) preserving root plates of storm-felled trees with partly retained trunks; (2) avoiding soil disturbance by using cable yarding instead of harvesters; (3) retaining sun-exposed dry branches of storm-felled trees and snags of beetle-killed spruces; (4) avoiding logging damage of natural regeneration and of large trees that survive disturbances; and (5) bark scratching instead of debarking to avoid bark beetle outbreaks while maintaining biodiversity. Windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks could be utilized to restore intensely managed forests of Central Europe to their natural composition and structure. Furthermore, experimentally mimicked natural disturbances might help in gaining a mechanistic understanding of how natural disturbances affect biodiversity.},

abstract = {Survival and growth of trees in high-mountain regions is limited by harsh environmental conditions, and is therefore sensitive to climate change. The main aims of this study were to develop the regional boundary line for high-mountain spruce forests of the Low Tatra Mts., to reconstruct and compare the disturbance regime of investigated localities, and to present the impact of recent climate change on release potential of Norway spruce. The study area included three localities with forest stands dominated by Norway spruce that were selected to represent the altitudinal zone 1200–1500 m a.s.l., excluding the tree line and extreme sites. In order to determine the most important climate characteristics driving tree growth, site chronologies were computed from the sample cores of dominant and co-dominant trees, and correlations between chronologies and monthly climate variables from the previous May to the current September were computed for the period 1901–2008. Analysis of release potential and disturbance histories was performed using the boundary line method. Uniform macro-climate and site conditions in the selected region enabled to construct the regional boundary line for Norway spruce in the Low Tatra. The comparison between boundary lines developed for Norway spruce in the Low Tatra and the other regions showed considerable differences. Therefore, in the high-mountain conditions, the transfer of boundary lines from other regions cannot be recommended. In investigated localities, we identified different disturbance regimes that resulted in variable stand structures and modified the growth responsiveness of Norway spruce to climate. A higher sensitivity to previous October temperature was observed in the most disturbed locality, whereas the growth of Norway spruce on the site with the lowest disturbance rates showed the highest correlation with current June–July temperature. After 1990, we registered enhanced release potential of Norway spruce accompanied by the increase of disturbance rates. Increased release potential was detected even for the trees older than 150 years.},

abstract = {Information regarding the extent, timing and magnitude of forest disturbance are key inputs required for accurate estimation of the terrestrial carbon balance. Equally important for studying carbon dynamics is the ability to distinguish the cause or type of forest disturbance occurring on the landscape. Wildfire and timber harvesting are common disturbances occurring in boreal forests, with each having differing carbon consequences (i.e., biomass removed, recovery rates). Development of methods to not only map, but distinguish these types of disturbance with satellite data will depend upon an improved understanding of their distinctive spectral properties. In this study, we mapped wildfires and clearcut harvests occurring in a Landsat time series (LTS) acquired in the boreal plains of Saskatchewan, Canada. This highly accurate reference map (kappa = 0.91) depicting the year and cause of historical disturbances was used to determine the spectral and temporal properties needed to accurately classify fire and clearcut disturbances. The results showed that spectral data from the short-wave infrared (SWIR; e.g., Landsat band 5) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was most effective at separating fires and clearcut harvests possibly due to differences in structure, shadowing, and amounts of exposed soil left behind by the two disturbance types. Although SWIR data acquired 1 year after disturbance enabled the most accurate discrimination of fires and clearcut harvests, good separation (e.g., kappa≥0.80) could still be achieved with Landsat band 5 and other SWIR-based indices 3 to 4 years after disturbance. Conversely, minimal disturbance responses in near infrared-based indices associated with green leaf area (e.g., NDVI) led to unreliably low classification accuracies regardless of time since disturbance. In addition to exploring the spectral and temporal manifestation of forest disturbance types, we also demonstrate how Landsat change maps which attribute cause of disturbance can be used to help elucidate the social, ecological and carbon consequences associated with wildfire and clearcut harvesting in Canadian boreal forests. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {A new change detection algorithm for continuous monitoring of forest disturbance at high temporal frequency is developed. Using all available Landsat 7 images in two years, time series models consisting of sines and cosines are estimated for each pixel for each spectral band. Dropping the coefficients that capture inter-annual change, time series models can predict surface reflectance for pixels at any location and any date assuming persistence of land cover. The Continuous Monitoring of Forest Disturbance Algorithm (CMFDA) flags forest disturbance by differencing the predicted and observed Landsat images. Two algorithms (single-date and multi-date differencing) were tested for detecting forest disturbance at a Savannah River site. The map derived from the multi-date differencing algorithm was chosen as the final CMFDA result, due to its higher spatial and temporal accuracies. It determines a disturbance pixel by the number of times "change" is observed consecutively. Pixels showing "change" for one or two times are flagged as "probable change". If the pixel is flagged for the third time, the pixel is determined to have changed. The accuracy assessment shows that CMFDA results were accurate for detecting forest disturbance, with both producer's and user's accuracies higher than 95{\%} in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of approximately 94{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Detailed knowledge of forest cover dynamics is crucial for many applications from resource management to ecosystem service assessments. Landsat data provides the necessary spatial, temporal and spectral detail to map and analyze forest cover and forest change processes. With the opening of the Landsat archive, new opportunities arise to monitor forest dynamics on regional to continental scales. In this study we analyzed changes in forest types, forest disturbances, and forest recovery for the Carpathian ecoregion in Eastern Europe. We generated a series of image composites at five year intervals between 1985 and 2010 and utilized a hybrid analysis strategy consisting of radiometric change classification, post-classification comparison and continuous index- and segment-based post-disturbance recovery assessment. For validation of the disturbance map we used a point-based accuracy assessment, and assessed the accuracy of our forest type maps using forest inventory data and statistically sampled ground truth data for 2010. Our Carpathian-wide disturbance map achieved an overall accuracy of 86{\%} and the forest type maps up to 73{\%} accuracy. While our results suggested a small net forest increase in the Carpathians, almost 20{\%} of the forests experienced stand-replacing disturbances over the past 25. years. Forest recovery seemed to only partly counterbalance the widespread natural disturbances and clear-cutting activities. Disturbances were most widespread during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but some areas also exhibited extensive forest disturbances after 2000, especially in the Polish, Czech and Romanian Carpathians. Considerable shifts in forest composition occurred in the Carpathians, with disturbances increasingly affecting coniferous forests, and a relative decrease in coniferous and mixed forests. Both aspects are likely connected to an increased vulnerability of spruce plantations to pests and pathogens in the Carpathians. Overall, our results exemplify the highly dynamic nature of forest cover during times of socio-economic and institutional change, and highlight the value of the Landsat archive for monitoring these dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Ecosystems and ecosystem services are subjected to both typical disturbances (e.g., fire) and shifting climatic baselines resulting from anthropogenic drivers. Recovery from these perturbations is of prime interest to researchers and land managers. We explore how differing regeneration of the coniferous forest to specific disturbances and a shifting climate are mediated through managerial responses, in terms of both species composition and an important ecosystem service, carbon sequestration in the southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. 112 sites across a variety of disturbance histories were surveyed for post-fire regeneration; carbon stock growth was then simulated in the US Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator under a variety of climate change scenarios for 100. years. Simultaneously, we simulated three managerial responses to the disturbance: no action, planting of local species (resilience-oriented management), and planting of the most climatically suitable species (adaptation-oriented management). These managerial responses simulate varying levels of intervention which attempt to maintain forest properties and associated carbon stocks. Carbon stocks, initially, were more resilient than the coniferous forest system; areas with little coniferous regeneration recovered carbon at a similar pace due to an influx of deciduous seedlings. However, future climate exerts a strong influence on carbon stocks. Both the no-action scenario and the resilience-oriented management scenario transitioned to non-forest by the end of the simulation period, due to climatic changes. Active, adaptation-oriented management, which included establishment of non-local species, maintained forest structure and carbon stocks under most future climate projections, albeit at lower densities. So while this preserves the presence of a forest, it does not preserve the presence of a specific forest. However, for ecosystem services associated with the mere existence of forest cover (e.g., carbon stocks and general forest habitat), this may be sufficient. In a sense, disturbances are opportunities for more climatically-adapted species/communities to establish, although the complexities of assisted migration and novel ecosystems remain. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fire, insects, and human activities are the dominant drivers of forest disturbance at the global scale. Because forests are geographically extensive and are often remote, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is uniquely suited to monitor the state and health of forested ecosystems. However, the extent to which coarse-resolution remote sensing data can accurately capture spatial and temporal patterns of disturbance is unclear. To investigate this, we developed an 11-year time series of MODIS Normalized Burn Ratio images corresponding to peak-growing season conditions for a study area located in the Pacific Northwest of the conterminous United States. Using a temporal segmentation algorithm that was originally developed using Landsat TM and ETM data, we created annual maps of forest disturbance from these time series. We then compared these maps to a database of annual forest disturbance that was compiled using Landsat TM/ETM data for the same region. Results from this comparison revealed that about half of all pixels affected by disturbances that occupied more than 5{\%} of a MODIS pixel were correctly identified as disturbed, including 79{\%} of those that were affected by disturbances larger than one-third of a MODIS pixel. Our results also show that the size, severity, and timing of disturbance events, along with gridding artifacts inherent to MODIS data, interact in complex ways that influence the signature of forest disturbance events in MODIS data. These results demonstrate both the utility as well as the limitations of MODIS and other coarse spatial resolution sensors for monitoring forest disturbance at regional to global scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The red edge position (REP) in the vegetation spectral reflectance is a surrogate measure of vegetation chlorophyll content, and hence can be used to monitor the health and function of vegetation. The Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the future ESA Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite will provide the opportunity for estimation of the REP at much higher spatial resolution (20. m) than has been previously possible with spaceborne sensors such as Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) aboard ENVISAT. This study aims to evaluate the potential of S-2 MSI sensor for estimation of canopy chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll concentration (LCC) using data from multiple field campaigns. Included in the assessed field campaigns are results from SEN3Exp in Barrax, Spain composed of 35 elementary sampling units (ESUs) of LCC and LAI which have been assessed for correlation with simulated MSI data using a CASI airborne imaging spectrometer. Analysis also presents results from SicilyS2EVAL, a campaign consisting of 25 ESUs in Sicily, Italy supported by a simultaneous Specim Aisa-Eagle data acquisition. In addition, these results were compared to outputs from the PROSAIL model for similar values of biophysical variables in the ESUs. The paper in turn assessed the scope of S-2 for retrieval of biophysical variables using these combined datasets through investigating the performance of the relevant Vegetation Indices (VIs) as well as presenting the novel Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI) and Sentinel-2 Red-Edge Position (S2REP). Results indicated significant relationships between both canopy chlorophyll content and LAI for simulated MSI data using IRECI or the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) while S2REP and the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) were found to have the strongest correlation for retrieval of LCC. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {The aim of this study is to bring a unique overview of past, current and plausible future land use development in Slovakia. The study assessed land change processes and their spatial determinants related to the most significant socio-political periods that have shaped the former socialist country over the past 30 years, namely, socialism (1980–1990), postsocialism (1990–2000), EU accession (2000–2006), EU membership (2006–2012). Using boosted regression trees, the impact of different biophysical, socioeconomic, policy and distance-based factors was evaluated on land transitions, categorised as urbanisation, agricultural intensification and extensification, afforestation, deforestation and forest disturbance (natural and management-induced). Results show significant shifts in the landscape management associated with the institutional changes, especially in the postsocialist period. Agricultural intensification, which dominated the socialist period, was in subsequent periods substituted by afforestation and agricultural extensification. High relative annual rates of forest disturbance have dominated land-use change over the past 30 years, while deforestation was a minor land-use change during the late socialist period. Urbanisation has played a significant role and changed considerably through the studied periods: high urbanisation rates under socialism, a massive decline in the postsocialism and EU accession periods and increasingly high urbanisation rates during the EU membership period. Taking into account national and international (EU related) demands, we assessed land use development for 2040 within five different future land use scenarios. These scenarios were characterised as either extensions of current development trends, or as developments along axes that target globalisation or regionalisation, and more or less intervention. Results show that afforestation is by far the land-change process that will have the greatest impact on future Slovakian landscapes, mostly in rural areas. Among changes in agriculture, all scenarios uniformly suggest that extensification will exceed intensification mostly at the cost of arable land. In addition, urban areas will expand at the expense of arable land, particularly in the accessible city hinterlands.},

abstract = {Land cover change is one of the major contributors to global change, but long-term, broad-scale, detailed and spatially explicit assessments of land cover change are largely missing, although the availability of historical maps in digital formats is increasing. The problem often lies in efficiency of analyses of historical maps for large areas. Our goal was to assess different methods to reconstruct land cover and land use from historical maps to identify a time-efficient and reliable method for broad-scale land cover change analysis. We compared two independent forest cover reconstruction methods: first, regular point sampling, and second, wall-to-wall mapping, and tested both methods for the Polish Carpathians (20,000 km2) for the 1860s, 1930s and 1970s. We compared the two methods in terms of their reliability for forest change analysis, relative to sampling error, point location and landscape context including local forest cover, area of the spatial reference unit and forest edge-to-core ratio. Our results showed that the point-based analysis overestimated forest cover in comparison to wall-to-wall mapping by 1-3{\%}, depending on the mapping period. The reasons for the differences were mainly the backdating approach and map generalisation rather than the point grid position or sampling error. When we compared forest cover trajectories over time, we found that the point-based reconstruction captured forest cover dynamics with a comparable accuracy to the wall-to-wall mapping. More broadly, our assessment showed that historical maps can provide valuable data on long-term land cover trends, and that point-based sampling can be an efficient and accurate way to assess forest area and change trends. We suggest that our point-based approach could allow land cover mapping across much of Europe starting in the 1800s. Our findings are important because they suggest that land cover change, a key component of global change, can be assessed over large areas much further back in time than it is commonly done. This would allow to truly understand path dependencies, land use legacies, and historical drivers of land cover change.},

abstract = {Recent studies have assessed the ecological effects of climate change on boreal forests; however, our understanding of the economic impacts of climate change on timber supply remains limited. Forestry is an important boreal industry; hence, it is necessary to better understand the ecological impacts that directly and indirectly affect this sector. We reviewed published literature concerning ecological impacts of climate change on biome shifts, regional forest disturbances, and tree growth, mortality and species compositional shifts in established forest stands. Subsequently, we examined how each factor influences timber supply and forestry. Tree species ranges have been and will continue migrating north to find more suitable growing conditions, but at a slower rate than climate change. Biome shifts from forests to shrub or grasslands may occur under persistent drought conditions. Warmer temperatures and lower climate moisture availability increase forest disturbances; notably fire and insect outbreaks, creating younger forests dominated by pioneer species and limiting harvestable material. While tree growth and mortality rates are spatially variable across established forest regions, tree mortality has temporally increased with climate change; accompanied by reduced growth or increased growth at a rate lower than mortality loss, resulting in a reduced rate of volume accumulation and timber available for harvest. Moreover, climate change favors pioneer species (Pinus spp. and Populus spp.) over late successional species (Picea spp. and Abies spp.). Our findings suggest that climate change has strong negative effects on boreal timber supply but may prompt operational adaptations, opening opportunities for forest industry to incorporate species such as Populus.},

abstract = {Mass-propagation of the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, following windfalls and drought is a serious threat to mature spruce forests. Climate change will affect the population dynamics of I. typographus directly as the swarming activity and development rate are mainly controlled by temperature, and indirectly via changes in availability of brood trees. Today, I. typographus is in general univoltine in southern Sweden. In Denmark, however, the weather conditions usually support the production of a second generation. By modelling the temperature dependent population dynamics, we have evaluated the effect of regional climate change scenarios for the period of 2070-2099 on I. typographus in southern Sweden. Our results indicate that temperature increase will have a step-wise effect on the population dynamics. Earlier spring swarming and a faster development from egg to mature bark beetle increase the probability of a second swarming period during summer. A second swarming will be customary with an annual mean temperature increase of 2-3 °C. The thermal requirement for development of a second generation may, however, not be fulfilled every year with an annual mean temperature increase less than 5-6 °C. Winter is fatal for immature bark beetles, and the larger the temperature increase, the higher the probability that the second generation will complete development and survive hibernation. The temperature regime during autumn will therefore have a decisive impact on the size of the swarming population next spring. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A linear PC-based airflow model Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP) is used here to study how forest management, especially clear-cutting, influences the local wind climate in terms of mean regional wind velocity and the local occurrence of high wind velocities, due to changes in surface roughness. Wind velocity variations are examined first at a management unit level of 64 km2 over the interval between two stand inventories (1990 and 2001) and secondly in a smaller area where new forest edges were created through different clear-cutting options. Results show that a change in landscape in terms of a decrease of approximately 17{\%} in the area of old forests did not have any clear effect on regional mean wind velocity. However, under conditions of high wind velocity the change in surface roughness caused a locally significant increase in the windthrow risk. Furthermore, if clear-cutting are carried out as soon as the forest stands reach the minimum acceptable mean diameter (or stand age) this will increase the proportion of clear-cut areas and thus also the proportion of areas experiencing high wind velocities. However, the risk of windthrow does not necessarily increase as straightforwardly at the regional level if the vulnerable old stands are cut. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Forest wind damage occurs under the passage of strong intermittent wind gusts at tree level. In order to predict the probability of tree damage of a forest, a simple statistical wind speed model was developed and coupled to a tree swaying model. The wind model is based on a stochastic approach and on some universal characters of normalized wind statistics at canopy top. This model aims at generating high frequency (10 Hz) time series of the three wind velocity components at canopy top knowing only the wind intensity from a nearby meteorological station and the height and cumulative plant area index of the forest. Compared to field measurements and large-eddy simulations over different canopy structures and densities, the wind model was able to reproduce accurately the main features of canopy-top wind dynamics, in particular the signature of the mixing-layer type coherent eddy structures developing at canopy top. Coupled with a tree swaying model, the model has allowed to predict the probability of wind damage of forest following the windstorm intensity and duration, and following the main tree characteristics resulting from silvicultural scenarios. By responding to some weaknesses of existing mechanistic wind risk models, this simple wind-tree interaction model may represent the first step toward a new generation of mechanistic wind risk models based on a probabilistic approach.},

abstract = {Humans have altered land cover for centuries, and land-cover change is a main component of global change. Land use transition trajectories, such as the forest transition theory (i.e. switch from deforestation to stable or increasing forest cover), relate long term changes in land use to gradual changes in underlying drivers, such as economic development, demographic change, and urbanization. However, because only few studies examined land change over centuries, it is not clear how land cover changes during very long time-periods which are punctuated by shifts in socio-economics and policies, such as wars. Our goal here was to examine broad land change patterns and processes, and their main driving forces in Central and Eastern Europe during distinct periods of the past 250 years. We conducted a meta-analysis of 66 publications describing 102 case study locations and quantified the main forest and agricultural changes in the Carpathian region since the 18th century. These studies captured gradual changes since the peak of the Austro-Hungarian Empire up to the accession to the European Union of most of the formerly socialist countries in the study region. Agricultural land-use increased during the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 70{\%} of the case studies, but dropped sharply during and especially after the collapse of the Socialism (over 70{\%} of the cases). The highest rates of abandonment occurred between 1990 and 2000. The Carpathian region experienced forest transition during the Interwar period (93{\%} of the cases), and the forest expansion trend persisted after the collapse of Socialism (70{\%} of the cases). In terms of the drivers, institutional and economic factors were most influential in shaping deforestation and agricultural expansion, while socio-demographics and institutional shifts were the key drivers of land abandonment. Our study highlights the drastic effects that socio-economic and institutional changes can have on land-use and land-cover change, and the value of longitudinal studies of land change to uncover these effects. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Spruce bark beetle outbreaks are common in Norway spruce forests following windstorm damage, due to ample availability of brood material. The realization of an outbreak depends on factors regulating the Ips typographus population dynamics, such as weather conditions and salvage cutting. In this study, we take an ecosystem modelling approach to analyse the influence of multiple environmental factors on the risk for I. typographus outbreaks. Model calculations of I. typographus phenology and population dynamics as a function of weather and brood tree availability were developed and implemented in the LPJ-GUESS ecosystem modelling framework. The model simulations were driven by gridded climate data covering Sweden with a spatial resolution of 0.5° and a daily temporal resolution. Records on storm damage and I. typographus outbreak periods in Sweden for the period of 1960-2009 were used for model evaluation, and a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the model behaviour. The model simulations replicated the observed pattern in outbreak frequency, being more common in southern and central Sweden than in northern Sweden. A warmer climate allowing for more than one generation per year can increase the risk for attacks on living trees. The effect of countermeasures, aiming at either reduce the availability of brood material or the I. typographus population size, is dependent on a non-linear relation between I. typographus attack density and reproductive success. The sensitivity analysis indicated a major reduction in the risk of attacks on living trees by timely salvage cutting and cutting of infested trees. Knowledge uncertainties associated with attacks on standing trees, i.e. factors influencing tree defence capacity and I. typographus reproductive success, should be further addressed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Extensive outbreaks of bark beetles have affected not only large parts of coniferous forests in the Northern Hemisphere, but also — largely absent from global attention — native pine forests of Central America. As such outbreaks frequently spark management debates among residents, land managers, forest owners and the public, the social acceptance of bark beetle control measures has become crucial for modern land management. However, the sociological and psychological determinants of the preference for specific bark beetle control measures outside protected areas remain unclear. To determine the acceptability of bark beetle control measures in El Salvador, we assessed how demographic variables, attitude towards the bark beetle, education, and self-reported knowledge affected the preference for different bark beetle control measures in a survey of government employees and local forest owners using a quantitative questionnaire survey. Cumulative link mixed models revealed that the general preference for control measures increased with increasing self-reported knowledge about the bark beetle but decreased with increasing level of respondent education and an increasing positive attitude towards the bark beetle. Respondents generally preferred beetle control measures on small areas than on large areas. Preferences for control measures did not differ between government employees and forest owners, with controlled burning and chemical control significantly less accepted than stand thinning or salvage logging. We discuss the most preferred control measures considering recent scientific evidence of their efficacy and conclude that the current bark beetle outbreak should be controlled through logging of pines weakened by fire in the short-term and by stand thinning in the medium-term to prevent further outbreaks.},

abstract = {{\&} Context Uneven-aged management systems based on selec-tion silviculture have become popular in European mountain forests and progressively replace other silvicultural practices. In time, this trend could lead to a homogenisation of the forest mosaic with consequences on structural indices recognised as beneficial to forest biodiversity. {\&} Aims This study was conducted to investigate the potential effects of a generalisation of the selection silvicultural system on structural diversity in the forest landscape with conse-quences for forest biodiversity conservation. {\&} Methods We compared four structural indices (tree species richness, diameter heterogeneity, deadwood volume and basal area of mature trees) in five different stand types typical of the northern French Alps, using forest plot data in the Vercors mountain range. Through virtual landscape simulations, we then calculated predicted mean proportions of stand types under two different conservation strategies: (i) maximising mean index values at the landscape level and (ii) maximising the number of plots in the landscape with index values above given thresholds. {\&} Results Multi-staged forests did not maximise all indices, the best solution being to combine the five stand types in uneven proportions to improve biodiversity conservation. {\&} Conclusion The expansion of selection silviculture in Euro-pean heterogeneous forest landscapes could enhance biodi-versity conservation if other stand types with complementary structural characteristics are maintained.},

abstract = {The recent free availability of Landsat historical data provides new potentials for land-cover change studies. Multi-temporal studies require a previous radiometric and geometric homogenization of input images, to better identify true changes. Topographic normalization is one of the key steps to create consistent and radiometricly stable multi-temporal time series, since terrain shadows change throughout time. This paper aims to evaluate different methods for topographic correction of Landsat TM-ETM+ data. They were assessed for 15 ETM+ images taken under different illumination conditions, using two criteria: (a) reduction of the standard deviation (SD) for different land-covers and (b) increase in temporal stability of a time series for individual pixels. We observed that results improve when land-cover classes where processed independently when applying the more advanced correction algorithms such as the C-correction and the Minnaert correction. Best results were obtaining for the C-correction and the empiric-statistic correction. Decreases of the SD for bare soil pixels were larger than 100{\%} for the C-correction and the empiric-statistic correction method compared to the other correction methods in the visible spectrum and larger than 50{\%} in the IR region. In almost all tests the empiric-statistic method provided better results than the C-correction. When analyzing the multi-temporal stability, pixels under bad illumination conditions (northern orientation) improved after correction, while a deterioration was observed for pixels under good illumination conditions (southern orientation). Taken this observation into account, a simple but robust method for topographic correction of Landsat imagery is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus, L. (hereafter bark beetle), causes major economic loss to the forest industry in Europe, especially in Norway Spruce (Picea abies). To minimise economic loss and preclude a mass outbreak, early detection of bark beetle infestation (so-called “green attack” stage – a period at which trees are yet to show visual signs of infestation stress) is, therefore, a crucial step in the management of Norway spruce stands. It is expected that a bark beetle infestation at the green attack stage affects a tree's physiological and chemical status. However, the concurrent effect on key foliar biochemical such as foliar nitrogen and chlorophyll as well as spectral responses are not well documented in the literature. Therefore, in this study, the early detection of bark beetle green attacks is investigated by examining foliar biochemical and spectral properties (400–2000 nm). We also assessed whether bark beetle infestation affects the estimation accuracy of foliar biochemicals. An extensive field survey was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany, in the early summer of 2015 to collect leaf samples from 120 healthy and green attacked trees. The spectra of the leaf samples were measured using an ASD FieldSpec3 equipped with an integrating sphere. Significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) between healthy and infested needle samples were found in the mean reflectance spectra, with the most pronounced differences being observed in the NIR and SWIR regions between 730 and 1370 nm. Furthermore, significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) were found in the biochemical compositions (chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration) of healthy versus green attacked samples. Our results further demonstrate that the estimation accuracy of foliar chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations, utilising partial least square regression model, was lower for the infested compared to the healthy trees. We show that early stage of infestation reduces not only foliar biochemical content but also their retrieval accuracy. Our results further indicate that remote sensing measurements can be successfully used for the early detection of the bark beetle infestation. We demonstrated that bark beetle infestation at the green attack stage effects leaf spectral response as well as leaf biochemical properties and their retrievals from hyperspectral measurements.},

To obtain policies that are effective at both international and local levels requires careful analysis of the underlying mechanisms across scientific disciplines and approaches, and must take politics into account.

abstract = {Global climate change is expected to increase annual temperatures and decrease summer precipitation in Central Europe. Little is known of how forests respond to the interaction of these climate factors and if their responses depend on soil conditions. In a 3-year lysimeter experiment, we investigated the growth response of young mixed oak stands, on either acidic or calcareous soil, to soil water regime, air-warming and drought treatments corresponding to an intermediate climate change scenario. The air-warming and drought treatments were applied separately as well as in combination. The air-warming treatment had no effect on soil water availability, evapotranspiration or stand biomass. Decreased evapotranspiration from the drought-exposed stands led to significantly higher air and soil temperatures, which were attributed to impaired transpirational cooling. Water limitation significantly reduced the stand foliage, shoot and root biomass as droughts were severe, as shown in low leaf water potentials. Additional air warming did not enhance the drought effects on evapotranspiration and biomass, although more negative leaf water potentials were observed. After re-watering, evapotranspiration increased within a few days to pre-drought levels. Stands not subjected to the drought treatment produced significantly less biomass on the calcareous soil than on the acidic soil, probably due to P or Mn limitation. There was no difference in biomass and water regime between the two soils under drought conditions, indicating that nutrient availability was governed by water availability under these conditions. The results demonstrate that young oak stands can cope with severe drought and therefore can be considered for future forestry.},

abstract = {Standing live trap trees are one of the most commonly used trapping techniques against Ips typographus in Belgium. In this paper we present experiments designed to compare their efficiency for mass trapping against commercial Theysohn slot traps, in terms of numbers of insects killed. To begin with, a method to estimate the total number of beetles killed by a standing trap tree is developed. Traps and trap trees were presented to the beetles both separately (in experiments where the position of the traps and trap trees were changed each time the site was visited) and together (in such a way that the beetles were facing a binary choice). When presented separately, trap trees caught at least 1.7-3.5 times as many bark beetles as traps. However, towards the end of the experiments, their superiority decreased because of the more exposed position of their dispensers that emptied faster. In the binary-choice experiments, this decrease could be avoided by protecting the dispensers from sun and wind with a portion of PVC piping and by exposing the traps' dispensers. When the dispensers were, as they usually are, exposed on the trap trees and protected inside the traps, trap trees caught 3.4-4.0 times as many beetles as the traps; when the traps' dispensers were exposed and the trap trees' dispensers protected, this ratio increased to between 8.5 and 31.4. In practice, however, it was not clear whether this protection would produce a major reduction in the catches during the beginning of a trapping campaign, or if the additional catches performed during the end of this campaign could compensate for the reduction. Nevertheless, protected dispensers have a more constant attractive power and might provide a more secure control of bark-beetle populations. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Insect outbreaks are major forest disturbances, causing tree mortality across millions of ha in North America. Resultant spatial and temporal patterns of tree mortality can profoundly affect ecosystem structure and function. In this study, we evaluated the classification accuracy of multispectral imagery at different spatial resolutions. We used four-band digital aerial imagery (30-cm spatial resolution and aggregated to coarser resolutions) acquired over lodgepole pine-dominated stands in central Colorado recently attacked by mountain pine beetle. Classes of interest included green trees and multiple stages of post-insect attack tree mortality, including dead trees with red needles ("red-attack"), dead trees without needles ("gray-attack"), and non-forest. The 30-cm resolution image facilitated delineation of trees located in the field, which were used in image classification. We employed a maximum likelihood classifier using the green band, Red-Green Index (RGI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Pixel-level classification accuracies using this imagery were good (overall accuracy of 87{\%}, kappa=0.84), although misclassification occurred between a) sunlit crowns of live (green) trees and herbaceous vegetation, and b) sunlit crowns of gray- and red-attack trees and bare soil. We explored the capability of coarser resolution imagery, aggregated from the 30-cm resolution to 1.2, 2.4, and 4.2. m, to improve classification accuracy. We found the highest accuracy at the 2.4-m resolution, where reduction in omission and commission errors and increases in overall accuracy (90{\%}) and kappa (0.88) were achieved, and visual inspection indicated improved mapping. Pixels at this resolution included more shadow in forested regions than pixels in finer resolution imagery, thereby reducing forest canopy reflectance and allowing improved separation between forest and non-forest classes, yet were fine enough to resolve individual tree crowns better than the 4.2-m imagery. Our results illustrate that a classification of an image with a spatial resolution similar to the area of a tree crown outperforms that of finer and coarser resolution imagery for mapping tree mortality and non-forest classes. We also demonstrate that multispectral imagery can be used to separate multiple postoutbreak attack stages (i.e., red-attack and gray-attack) from other classes in the image. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

With nearly 40. years of continuous observation - since launch of the first satellite in 1972 - the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Even though windthrows are the main disturbance type in European forests, their impact on forest carbon balance is generally understudied. In order to close this knowledge gap, we took advantage of a tornado event, which occurred in July 2012 in Trzebciny Forest District in northwest Poland. The main objective of this study was to determine how two completely different reforestation techniques in windthrow areas impact net ecosystem production (NEP) of this Scots pine forest ecosystem under similar meteorological conditions. The two techniques were: conventional (“Tlen I” site): uprooted stumps pulled out and removed from the site followed by ploughing, and non-conventional (“Tlen II” site): all stumps left on the site to decompose with no ploughing. Therefore, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes using the eddy covariance (EC) technique for four continuous years. Our results indicate that both sites became significant carbon (C) sources after the windthrow (up to 575 ± 56 g C m−2 y-1 in the first year, Tlen I). However, the Tlen I (conventional technique) lost over 30{\%} less C than Tlen II during the 2015–2016 observation period. In contrast to existing knowledge, ploughing as done at Tlen I, did not substantially increase CO2 emission, as compared to local soil ripping (non-conventional technique). The decrease in net C emission, estimated on the basis of linear model parameters, was almost five times greater at Tlen I than at Tlen II. We thus hypothesize that the annual NEP at conventionally reforested windthrow site will reach C neutrality (NEP = 0) six years after windthrow at most, while at the non-conventionally managed area it will probably take ca. 18 years. So far then, the currently widely applied conventional reforestation technique in wind-disturbed Polish forest appeared to be more effective in decreasing C losses than a technique that leaves stumps to decompose and avoids ploughing.},

abstract = {Tree-killing bark beetles are major disturbance agents affecting coniferous forest ecosystems. The role of environmental conditions on driving beetle outbreaks is becoming increasingly important as global climatic change alters environmental factors, such as drought stress, that, in turn, govern tree resistance. Furthermore, dynamics between beetles and trees are highly nonlinear, due to complex aggregation behaviors exhibited by beetles attacking trees. Models have a role to play in helping unravel the effects of variable tree resistance and beetle aggregation on bark beetle outbreaks. In this article we develop a new mathematical model for bark beetle outbreaks using an analogy with epidemiological models. Because the model operates on several distinct time scales, singular perturbation methods are used to simplify the model. The result is a dynamical system that tracks populations of uninfested and infested trees. A limiting case of the model is a discontinuous function of state variables, leading to solutions in the Filippov sense. The model assumes an extensive seed-bank so that tree recruitment is possible even if trees go extinct. Two scenarios are considered for immigration of new beetles. The first is a single tree stand with beetles immigrating from outside while the second considers two forest stands with beetle dispersal between them. For the seed-bank driven recruitment rate, when beetle immigration is low, the forest stand recovers to a beetle-free state. At high beetle immigration rates beetle populations approach an endemic equilibrium state. At intermediate immigration rates, the model predicts bistability as the forest can be in either of the two equilibrium states: a healthy forest, or a forest with an endemic beetle population. The model bistability leads to hysteresis. Interactions between two stands show how a less resistant stand of trees may provide an initial toe-hold for the invasion, which later leads to a regional beetle outbreak in the resistant stand.},

abstract = {Estuaries are among the most invaded ecosystems on the planet. Such invasions have led in part, to the formation of a massive {\$}1 billion restoration effort in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. However, invasions of weeds into riparian, floodplain, and aquatic habitats threaten the success of restoration efforts within the watershed and jeopardize economic activities. The doctrine of early detection and rapid response to invasions has been adopted by land and water resource managers, and remote sensing is the logical tool of choice for identification and detection. However meteorological, physical, and biological heterogeneity in this large system present unique challenges to successfully detecting invasive weeds. We present three hyperspectral case studies which illustrate the challenges, and potential solutions, to mapping invasive weeds in wetland systems: 1) Perennial pepperweed was mapped over one portion of the Delta using a logistic regression model to predict weed occurrence. 2) Water hyacinth and 3) submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), primarily composed of Brazilian waterweed, were mapped over the entire Delta using a binary decision tree that incorporated spectral mixture analysis (SMA), spectral angle mapping (SAM), band indexes, and continuum removal products. Perennial pepperweed detection was moderately successful; phenological stage influenced detection rates. Water hyacinth was mapped with modest accuracies, and SAV was mapped with high accuracies. Perennial pepperweed and water hyacinth both exhibited significant spectral variation related to plant phenology. Such variation must be accounted for in order to optimally map these species, and this was done for the water hyacinth case study. Submerged aquatic vegetation was not mapped to the species level due to complex non-linear mixing problems between the water column and its constituents, which was beyond the scope of the current study. We discuss our study in the context of providing guidelines for future remote sensing studies of aquatic systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mountain pine beetle red attack damage has been successfully detected and mapped using single-date high spatial resolution ({\textless} 4 m) satellite multi-spectral data. Forest managers; however, need to monitor locations for changes in beetle populations over time. Specifically, counts of individual trees attacked in successive years provide an indication of beetle population growth and dynamics. Surveys are typically used to estimate the ratio of green (current) attack trees to red (previous) attack trees or G:R. In this study, we estimate average stand-level G:R using a time-series of QuickBird multi-spectral and panchromatic satellite data, combined with field data for three forested stands near Merritt, British Columbia, Canada. Using a ratio of QuickBird red to green wavelengths (Red-Green Index or RGI), the change in RGI ($\Delta$RGI) in successive image pairs is used to estimate red attack damage in 2004, 2005, and 2006, with true positive accuracies ranging from 89 to 93{\%}. To overcome issues associated with differing viewing geometry and illumination angles that impair tracking of individual trees through time, segments are generated from the QuickBird multi-spectral data to identify small groups of trees. These segments then serve as the vehicle for monitoring changes in red attack damage over time. A local maxima filter is applied to the panchromatic data to estimate stem counts, thereby allowing an indication of the total stand population at risk of attack. By combining the red attack damage estimates with the local maxima stem counts, predictions are made of the number of attacked trees in a given year. Backcasting the current year's red attack damaged trees as the previous year's green attack facilitates the estimation of an average stand G:R. In this study area, these retrospective G:R values closely match those generated from field surveys. The results of this study indicate that a monitoring program using a time series of high spatial resolution remotely sensed data (multi-spectral and panchromatic) over select sample locations, could be used to estimate G:R over large areas, facilitating landscape level management strategies and/or providing a mechanism for assessing the efficacy of previously implemented strategies.

abstract = {Illegal logging is a major environmental and economic problem, and exceeds in some countries the amounts of legally harvested timber. In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, illegal logging increased and reforestation on abandoned farmland was widespread after the breakdown of socialism, and the region's forest cover trends remain overall largely unclear. Our goal here was to map forest cover change and to assess the extent of illegal logging and reforestation in the Ukrainian Carpathians. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ images and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to derive forest change trajectories between 1988 and 2007 for the entire Ukrainian Carpathians. We calculated logging and reforestation rates, and compared Landsat-based forest trends to official statistics and inventory maps. Our classification resulted in reliable forest/non-forest maps (overall accuracies between 97.1{\%}-98.01{\%}) and high clear cut detection rates (on average 89.4{\%}). Forest cover change was widespread in the Ukrainian Carpathians between 1988 and 2007. We found forest cover increase in peripheral areas, forest loss in the interior Carpathians, and increased logging in remote areas. Overall, our results suggest that unsustainable forest use from socialist times likely persisted in the post-socialist period, resulting in a continued loss of older forests and forest fragmentation. Landsat-based forest trends differed substantially from official forest resource statistics. Illegal logging appears to have been at least as extensive as documented logging during the early 1990s and so-called sanitary clear-cuts represent a major loophole for overharvesting and logging in restricted areas. Reforestation and illegal logging are frequently not accounted for in forest resource statistics, highlighting limitations of these data. Combating illegal logging and transitioning towards sustainable forestry requires better monitoring and up-to-date accounting of forest resources, in the Carpathians and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and remote sensing can be a key technology to achieve these goals. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This research aims to discover the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing data for mapping mountain vegetation ecosystems. First, the importance of mountain ecosystems to the global system should be stressed due to mountainous ecosystems forming a very sensitive indicator of global climate change. Furthermore, a variety of biotic and abiotic factors influence the spatial distribution of vegetation in the mountains, producing a diverse mosaic leading to high biodiversity. The research area covers the Szrenica Mount region on the border between Poland and the Czech Republic - the most important part of the Western Karkonosze and one of the main areas in the Karkonosze National Park (M{\&}B Reserve of the UNESCO). The APEX hyperspectral data that was classified in this study was acquired on 10th September 2012 by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in the framework of the EUFAR HyMountEcos project. This airborne scanner is a 288-channel imaging spectrometer operating in the wavelength range 0.4-2.5 $\mu$m. For reference patterns of forest and non-forest vegetation, maps (provided by the Polish Karkonosze National Park) were chosen. Terrain recognition was based on field walks with a Trimble GeoXT GPS receiver. It allowed test and validation dominant polygons of 15 classes of vegetation communities to be selected, which were used in the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification. The SVM classifier is a type of machine used for pattern recognition. The result is a post classification map with statistics (total, user, producer accuracies, kappa coefficient and error matrix). Assessment of the statistics shows that almost all the classes were properly recognised, excluding the fern community. The overall classification accuracy is 79.13{\%} and the kappa coefficient is 0.77. This shows that hyperspectral images and remote sensing methods can be support tools for the identification of the dominant plant communities of mountain areas. {\textcopyright} University of Warsaw - Faculty of Geography and Regional Studies.},

abstract = {Production of marketed commodities and protection of biodiversity in natural systems often conflict and thus the continuously expanding human needs for more goods and benefits from global ecosystems urgently calls for strategies to resolve this conflict. In this paper, we addressed what is the potential of a forest landscape to simultaneously produce habitats for species and economic returns, and how the conflict between habitat availability and timber production varies among taxa. Secondly, we aimed at revealing an optimal combination of management regimes that maximizes habitat availability for given levels of economic returns. We used multi-objective optimization tools to analyze data from a boreal forest landscape consisting of about 30,000 forest stands simulated 50 years into future. We included seven alternative management regimes, spanning from the recommended intensive forest management regime to complete set-aside of stands (protection), and ten different taxa representing a wide variety of habitat associations and social values. Our results demonstrate it is possible to achieve large improvements in habitat availability with little loss in economic returns. In general, providing dead-wood associated species with more habitats tended to be more expensive than providing requirements for other species. No management regime alone maximized habitat availability for the species, and systematic use of any single management regime resulted in considerable reductions in economic returns. Compared with an optimal combination of management regimes, a consistent application of the recommended management regime would result in 5{\%} reduction in economic returns and up to 270{\%} reduction in habitat availability. Thus, for all taxa a combination of management regimes was required to achieve the optimum. Refraining from silvicultural thinnings on a proportion of stands should be considered as a cost-effective management in commercial forests to reconcile the conflict between economic returns and habitat required by species associated with dead-wood. In general, a viable strategy to maintain biodiversity in production landscapes would be to diversify management regimes. Our results emphasize the importance of careful landscape level forest management planning because optimal combinations of management regimes were taxon-specific. For cost-efficiency, the results call for balanced and correctly targeted strategies among habitat types. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Restoration of boreal forests by emulating natural disturbances is used to bring back typical components of natural forests that are reduced by silvicultural management. The volume, diversity and continuity of deadwood are the most important factors determining the diversity of deadwood-dependent species. In a large-scale experiment consisting of 43 experimental stands and 15 controls we assessed how alternative restoration methods enhancing deadwood availability (felling and felling + burning with two levels of felling: 20 and 40 {\{}{\%}{\}} of initial volume of living trees, and a storm treatment) would affect short- and long-term deadwood volume and diversity using 7-year deadwood measurements and simulation modelling. In short-term, restoration by felling + burning increased both the volume and diversity of deadwood, whereas felling only increased merely the volume of deadwood. The simulations of tree growth, mortality and wood decomposition indicated that in comparison to controls, felled and storm-treated stands have greater deadwood volumes up to 40 years and felled + burned stands more than 60 years after restoration. Our results suggest that felling with 20 {\{}{\%}{\}} of initial tree volume does not harm the future deadwood continuity, whereas intensive burning may imperil the deadwood continuity in a stand level. In conclusion, restoration clearly speeds up the development of the deadwood volumes needed to host large portions of biodiversity, and burning is the most effective restoration method in short- and long term. In practice, several restoration methods could be used concurrently in the landscape to obtain the best results.},

One likely reason for this failure is the limited attention paid to the regional and landscape level ecological characteristics in farmland conservation planning. We demonstrate how to obtain conservation prioritization solutions that would address simultaneously three goals, including two landscape level targets: minimizing local habitat quality loss, maximizing habitat connectivity, and incorporating landscape heterogeneity. As these goals may be contradictory, we investigate the potential trade-offs between them. We used the Zonation prioritization tool to examine how our three goals could be implemented in the agricultural landscapes of southwest Finland. We used measures of (i) biodiversity value of grasslands, (ii) connectivity between grasslands, and (iii) landscape heterogeneity which comprised of (land cover type based) compositional heterogeneity and (field margin based) configurational heterogeneity. Integration of landscape heterogeneity measures and habitat connectivity resulted in some trade-offs with local habitat quality, the most prominent observation being that landscape heterogeneity co-varied with grassland connectivity. Among the two landscape heterogeneity parameters, inclusion of compositional heterogeneity resulted in more clustered prioritization solutions than configurational heterogeneity, which had a spatially more balanced impact. Concordance among landscape scale factors implies high potential for reconstruction of a functioning network of semi-natural grasslands in areas under intensive agricultural use. Broader scale multi-objective planning approaches can thus importantly support targeting biodiversity conservation planning and mediating the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy objectives.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Ground-occurring Coleoptera were sampled over 2 years using pitfall traps in 23 northem hardwood or eastern hemlock-dominated sites representing even-aged, uneven-aged, or old growth forests. Overall, 65,586 individuals were obtained, representing 33 families and 192 species. Carabids comprised 54{\%} of the total catch in 1996, when all the families were tallied. There was little variation in the number and relative abundance of carabid species caught between seasons. No differences in overall species richness or abundance were observed among forest management regimes or habitat types. However, there were substantial differences in species composition. Thirteen species showed significant habitat associations among the five forest management regimes, and 21 species were associated with specific habitat features of the sites, such as dominant tree species or canopy structure. More species (16) were affected by the presence of forest management than by tree species dominance (6) or canopy structure (5). Harpalus fulvilabris, Pterostichus coracinus, Carabus nemoralis, Glischrochilus siepmanni, Nicrophorus orbicollis, and Nicrophorus sayi were more commonly caught in managed than in old growth forest sites, while Carabus sylvosus, Platynus decentis and Oiceoptoma novaboracensis were more commonly associated with old growth sites. Calosoma frigidum and Necrophila americana were associated with northem hardwood sites, while Platynus decentis was significantly associated with sites dominated by eastern hemlock. Calosoma frigidum, Necrophila americana, and Nicrophorus vespilloides were more common in even-aged sites, while a lampyrid and a leiodid morphospecies were more common in sites with an uneven-aged canopy structure. The importance of microsite features was reflected in the high variability observed among sites and among traps within sites. Results indicate that conservation of a range of forest types is required in order to maintain the diversity of ground-occurring beetles on a regional scale. This will be quite challenging, since forest types such as old growth hemlock-hardwood are rare across the landscape due to habitat fragmentation and logging. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Forest dieback of mountainous areas is a common problem in almost all regions of the world. This process is characterized by high variability and is independent of whether the process is caused by climate changes, insect pests or human impact on the environment, particularly environmental pollution. This state of affairs is probably influenced not only by unusual atmospheric conditions, unusual stressors or species composition but also by many factors that have not been identified to date. Even in the case of relatively small mountainous areas in Central Europe with similar species composition, climatic conditions, and stressors, the process of tree dieback might have different characteristics and causes. During the analyses of such phenomena, remote sensing technologies, such as LiDAR and aerial imagery, which have become increasingly popular and precise, are helpful. Additionally, access to geographic information systems has become common by forest owners. Using previous research, as well as airborne laser scanning data, aerial imagery and Polish State Forests IT system (SILP) data, it was possible to analyze almost 200,000 dead trees inventoried in the areas of the Western Sudety, Eastern Sudety, Beskid {\'{S}}l{\c{a}}ski and Beskid {\.{Z}}ywiecki mountain ranges. Despite the fact these areas are located relatively close to each other, they differ in terms of forest structure and in terms of period of mass deforerstation. The impact of detailed landform, age, and species composition were considered, and complemented many other factors, which eventually enabled the development of three different models for each of the analyzed areas. The models depict the influence of the respective factors of the environment on Norway spruce dieback in the Central Europe mountains. The obtained results show that there are certain factors, such as e.g. age or stocking, which increase the probability of damage in all three areas, but certain ones are significant exclusively for one or two areas, such as e.g. altitude, which has an influence on the likelihood of damage only in the Western Sudety and the Western Beskidy Mountains. What is interesting, the altitude does not impact unequivocally on the share of dead spruces itself, since in the case of the Western and Eastern Sudety, the increase of altitude is positively correlated with the share, whereas in the case of the Western Beskidy Mountains, the correlation is negative. An important fact is that the increase of deciduous species' share impacts positively on the forest dieback of spruces on all analyzed areas.},

abstract = {With an increasing pressure on forested landscapes, conservation areas may fail to maintain biodiversity if they are not supported by the surrounding managed forest matrix. Worldwide, forests are managed by one of two broad approaches-even- and uneven-aged silviculture. In recent decades, there has been rising public pressure against the systematic use of even-aged silviculture (especially clear-cutting) because of its perceived negative esthetic and ecological impacts. This led to an increased interest for uneven-aged silviculture. However, to date, there has been no worldwide ecological comparison of the two approaches, based on multiple indicators. Overall, for the 99 combinations of properties or processes verified (one study may have evaluated more than one property or process), we found nineteen (23) combinations that clearly showed uneven-aged silviculture improved the evaluated metrics compared to even-aged silviculture, eleven (16) combinations that showed the opposite, and 60 combinations that were equivocal. Furthermore, many studies were based on a limited study design without either a timescale (44 of the 76) or spatial (54 of the 76) scale consideration. Current views that uneven-aged silviculture is better suited than even-aged silviculture for maintaining ecological diversity and processes are not substantiated by our analyses. Our review, by studying a large range of indicators and many different taxonomic groups, also clearly demonstrates that no single approach can be relied on and that both approaches are needed to ensure a greater number of positive impacts. Moreover, the review clearly highlights the importance of maintaining protected areas as some taxonomic groups were found to be negatively affected no matter the management approach used. Finally, our review points to a lack of knowledge for determining the use of even- or uneven-aged silviculture in terms of both their respective proportion in the landscape and their spatial agency.},

abstract = {Woody debris provides substrate for a large part of forest biodiversity. Many saproxylic species are threatened by deadwood removal from commercial forests. However, deadwood availability alone may be insufficient to sustain those specialist species, given that naturally they inhabit diverse and dynamic forest ecosystems. We analysed the occurrence of saproxylic beetles under the conditions of semi-natural forestry in Estonia where managed stands are relatively rich in deadwood. We had two aims: (i) to estimate the role of deadwood amount taking into account other habitat factors for the beetles, and (ii) to contribute to the assessment of ecological sustainability of the silvicultural approaches used. The 128 studied stands represented four management stages: clear-cuts, retention cuts with solitary trees, mature commercial forests, and (as reference) old growth across a gradient of forest site-types. Using flight-intercept traps and rearing from wood samples, we captured 105 pre-defined habitat specialist species, of which 41{\%} were of regional conservation concern. Site-scale occurrence of 34 species modelled for habitat factors depended mostly on management stage and forest type. Harvested sites (particularly retention cuts) were primarily preferred, and dry pine sites had a distinct fauna. Thirteen percent of target species favoured old growth, but in general, the beetle assemblages in old growth resembled those in mature commercial forest. Statistical significance of any stand characteristics (site type; stand structure) was established in only 62{\%} of species, which indicates that there can be additional important factors, such as habitat connectivity, patch size or landscape history. These results highlight the importance of diverse forest management and protection approaches for deadwood-dwellers, which should aim for habitat heterogeneity along with substrate diversity. For beetle diversity, retention cutting performs much better than clear-cutting, but even deadwood-rich mature stands cannot fully substitute old growth. We conclude that deadwood abundance serves only as a starting consideration for reconciling timber production and the conservation of deadwood dependent biodiversity.},

After years of education and postdoctoral training, this first faculty job is a thrilling progression in a scientific career that allows us to develop our own research program and pursue the questions that most interest us, but starting a lab from scratch comes with a unique set of pressures and struggles. Luckily, Principle Investigators (PIs) don't have to walk alone, as most build teams to work with. Thus, one of the first and most important things to do at this critical career stage is to recruit team members. Subsequently, the PI leads and guides the group both in terms of the scientific projects and facilitating the career progression of the team members. While scientists are generally very well trained in designing and running experiments, most of us do not receive much, if any, training in the organizational skills needed for managing a group of people and inspiring them to do great work and plan for the future.

abstract = {In forest management, scenarios are often used to envision what the future might look like to account for uncertainties associated with, for example, climate change, changing socio-economic conditions, and technological developments. There are, however, many different methodological approaches to scenario building. In order to be able to make better use of the diversity of approaches at hand, a systematic overview of the scenario methodologies, which is currently missing in the forest sector, is needed. This paper analysed and reviewed 129 forest-management-related scenario studies that have been carried out in Europe during the past decade. The studies were classified by means of cluster analysis in four groups: (1) management scenarios, (2) environmental scenarios, (3) optimization scenarios, and (4) participatory scenarios. Despite differences between the four groups, almost all scenario studies can be characterized as rather quantitative, non-participatory, and single factor in nature. The analysis also found a temporal trend reflecting a broadening of the scenario methodology for forest management over time towards scenarios that incorporate longer time horizons, reflecting issues on a larger scale, including land-use considerations. Considering the complexity and urgency of the issues in forest management that need to be addressed and the opportunities offered by the scenario methodologies not yet fully used, we expect to see a further broadening of the scenario methodology with mixed-method, participatory, and complex scenarios.},

abstract = {Germany's forests provide a variety of ecosystem services. Sustainable forest management aims to optimize the provision of these services at regional level. However, climate change will impact forest ecosystems and subsequently ecosystem services. The objective of this study is to quantify the effects of two alternative management scenarios and climate impacts on forest variables indicative of ecosystem services related to timber, habitat, water, and carbon. The ecosystem services are represented through nine model output variables (timber harvest, above and belowground biomass, net ecosystem production, soil carbon, percolation, nitrogen leaching, deadwood, tree dimension, broadleaf tree proportion) from the process-based forest model 4C. We simulated forest growth, carbon and water cycling until 2045 with 4C setup for the whole German forest area based on National Forest Inventory data and driven by three management strategies (nature protection, biomass production and a baseline management) and an ensemble of regional climate scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5). We provide results as relative changes compared to the baseline management and observed climate. Forest management measures have the strongest effects on ecosystem services inducing positive or negative changes of up to 40{\%} depending on the ecosystem service in question, whereas climate change only slightly alters ecosystem services averaged over the whole forest area. The ecosystem services 'carbon' and 'timber' benefit from climate change, while 'water' and 'habitat' lose. We detect clear trade-offs between 'timber' and all other ecosystem services, as well as synergies between 'habitat' and 'carbon'. When evaluating all ecosystem services simultaneously, our results reveal certain interrelations between climate and management scenarios. Northeastern and western forest regions are more suitable to provide timber (while minimizing the negative impacts on remaining ecosystem services) whereas southern and central forest regions are more suitable to fulfil 'habitat' and 'carbon' services. The results provide the base for future forest management optimizations at the regional scale in order to maximize ecosystem services and forest ecosystem sustainability at the national scale.},

abstract = {Conservation strategies are often established without consideration of the impact of climate change. However, this impact is expected to threaten species and ecosystem persistence and to have dramatic effects towards the end of the 21st century. Landscape suitability for species under climate change is determined by several interacting factors including dispersal and human land use. Designing effective conservation strategies at regional scales to improve landscape suitability requires measuring the vulnerabilities of specific regions to climate change and determining their conservation capacities. Although methods for defining vulnerability categories are available, methods for doing this in a systematic, cost-effective way have not been identified. Here, we use an ecosystem model to define the potential resilience of the Finnish forest landscape by relating its current conservation capacity to its vulnerability to climate change. In applying this framework, we take into account the responses to climate change of a broad range of red-listed species with different niche requirements. This framework allowed us to identify four categories in which representation in the landscape varies among three IPCC emission scenarios (B1, low; A1B, intermediate; A2, high emissions): (i) susceptible (B1 = 24.7{\%}, A1B = 26.4{\%}, A2 = 26.2{\%}), the most intact forest landscapes vulnerable to climate change, requiring management for heterogeneity and resilience; (ii) resilient (B1 = 2.2{\%}, A1B = 0.5{\%}, A2 = 0.6{\%}), intact areas with low vulnerability that represent potential climate refugia and require conservation capacity maintenance; (iii) resistant (B1 = 6.7{\%}, A1B = 0.8{\%}, A2 = 1.1{\%}), landscapes with low current conservation capacity and low vulnerability that are suitable for restoration projects; (iv) sensitive (B1 = 66.4{\%}, A1B = 72.3{\%}, A2 = 72.0{\%}), low conservation capacity landscapes that are vulnerable and for which alternative conservation measures are required depending on the intensity of climate change. Our results indicate that the Finnish landscape is likely to be dominated by a very high proportion of sensitive and susceptible forest patches, thereby increasing uncertainty for landscape managers in the choice of conservation strategies.},

abstract = {Disturbance regimes in much of the boreal forest have shifted from wildfire to clearcutting over the last century, resulting in concerns for biodiversity. Because the boreal forest has evolved under a natural fire regimes, we hypothesized that application of prescribed burning (PB) after clearcutting would result in plant communities more similar to wildfire than clearcut only. However, because clearcutting+PB involves multiple disturbances in a short interval, we proposed an alternate hypothesis that clearcutting+PB would result in a species composition and trait assemblage that differ from those that develop after a single wildfire or clearcutting event. We determined species composition, diversity, and trait composition of 17 clearcut, 17 clearcut+PB, and 15 wildfire sites of jack pine ( Pinus banksiana) dominated forests in northwestern Ontario, Canada 15-37 years after disturbance. Contrary to our primary hypothesis we found that clearcut+PB formed communities different from wildfire and clearcut, the latter two being similar. Clearcut+PB harbored more early successional species associated with seed banking, wind dispersal, deciduous foliage, and alien origin than wildfire or clearcut sites, which showed no specific trait associations. Taxonomic and trait analysis of clearcut+PB sites exhibited effects of compound disturbances, as observed after short-interval fires, supporting our alternate hypothesis. We concluded that PB after clearcutting formed plant communities significantly different from those developed either after clearcutting or wildfire alone. We attribute this community divergence to the compounding effects associated with the addition of prescribed fire to these previously disturbed forests.},

However, methods that change the focus of evaluation from patterns to processes have begun to surface; that is, rather than asking if a model simulates a correct pattern, models are evaluated on their ability to simulate a process of interest. We build on an existing agent-based modeling validation method in order to present a temporal variant-invariant analysis (TVIA). The enhanced method, which focuses on analyzing the uncertainty in simulation results, examines the degree to which outcomes from multiple model runs match some reference to how land use parcels make the transition from one land use class to another over time.We apply TVIA to results from an agent-based model that simulates the relationships between land- owner decisions and wildfire risk in the wildland-urban interface of the southern Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. The TVIA approach demonstrates a novel ability to examine uncertainty across time to provide an understanding of how the model emulates the system of interest. 1},

abstract = {The effect of soil conditions on root development and anchorage against wind-throw in Britain is examined briefly, with reference to recent original observations in that country and work by others in central Europe. The crux is held to be the gripping of an adequate insert mass of soil by the roots. The importance of drainage is brought out, and the danger when exceptional weather makes the critical layers of a soil semi-liquid and unstable. No root disease need be associated with overturning in such conditions. On the other hand, beech on shallow soil over chalk may be wind-thrown through starvation and death of roots running down 5 or 6 ft. into the fissured chalk rock. The physics of ditch draining require study, and so does the ability of various tree species to maintain natural drainage. Where there is special danger of wind-throw it is held that thinning practice should favour deep crowns rather than shallow, and silviculture should favour an irregular rather than an even canopy. Particular types of soil and vegetation in Britain where the danger of wind-throw is high are mentioned, with special reference to spruce (Picea spp.).},

abstract = {A photometrical method to measure the relative fat content of bark beetles and other small invertebrates is presented. The method is less labour intensive than extraction of the fat with petroleum ether. A relation is found between the weight of the elytra and the beetle's dry weight which permits comparison of beetle's size by comparing the weight of their elytra. From the absolute fat content and the elytra weight the relative fat content (mg fat/mg dry weight) can be calculated.The method described has been used to measure the changes in size and fat content of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus and the effect of attack density on these characteristics. Nine logs in netting cages were attacked by I. typographus beetles at attack densities ranging from 0.15 to 2.59 entrance holes dm−2 bark. The emerging offspring beetles were sampled twice a week and their size and relative fat content measured. The following conclusions were reached:1. Twenty seven percent of the offspring had emerged from the logs by the 16th October when emergence nearly stopped because of low temperatures.2. The males emerged on average before the females.3. The size and fat content of the emerging beetles is positively correlated with the time of emergence.4. The size and fat content of the emerging beetles is negatively correlated with attack density.

The thematic maps derived from remotely-sensed images are invaluable sources of information for various investigations since they provide spatial and temporal information about the nature of Earth surface materials and objects. The robustness of classification techniques used to produce these thematic maps can be crucial especially for complex classification problems. This study aims to determine the level of contributions of multi-temporal and multi-sensor data together with their principal components for Maximum Likelihood and Artificial Neural Network classifiers. The performance of a multi-layer perceptron that learns the characteristics of the data using backpropagation algorithm is compared to that of Maximum Likelihood classifier in identifying major land cover classes present in the study area, Beykoz district of Istanbul, Turkey. The image data available for the study are from Landsat ETM+ and Terra ASTER images. Image band combinations are inputted to the neural network for training and the success of the classification is tested using test data sets. Results show that the neural network approach is an attractive and effective way of extracting land cover information using multi-spectral, multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite images. It is also observed that the level of contribution of principal components to the results is much less than the contribution of multi-temporal data in terms of the classification accuracy.},

@article{Birkmann2010,
abstract = {Statistical data shows that the increase in disasters due to natural hazards over the past 20 years has, for the most part, been caused by meteorological and hydrological events. This increase has been largely assigned to climate change [Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), 2010, http://www.emdat.be/Database/Trends/trends.html], that is, with climate-related hazards being major triggers for the majority of disasters. Consequently, there is obvious concern about how a changing climate will exacerbate the situation in the future (McBean and Ajibade in Curr Opin Environ Sustain 1:179-186, 2009). However, the attribution of a single hazard event or specific losses to climate change is still difficult, if not impossible, due to the complexity of factors that generate disaster losses. Disaster risk is a product of the interaction of the hazard (event) and the vulnerability conditions of the society or elements exposed. As a result, the need for a systematic linkage between disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) to advance sustainable development, and finally human security is being discussed within the ongoing climate change negotiations as well as within the disaster risk community, for example, in the framework of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on 'Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation'. However, crucial differences between DRR and CCA exist that have widely limited or hampered their integration in practice. A review of existing literature on the topic and current national and local adaptation strategies, as well as 38 expert interviews conducted between April and May 2009, have led the authors to hypothesise that most of these differences and challenges can be categorised with respect to different spatial and temporal scales, the knowledge base, and norm systems. This paper examines the reasons for the practical barriers when linking CCA and DRR according to these three aspects. Finally, we outline recommendations and measures that need to be adopted in order to overcome existing barriers. In addition, quality criteria are formulated that should be applied in order to constantly monitor and evaluate adaptation strategies designed to simultaneously meet DRR requirements and vice versa.

Long-term documentation make detailed investigations to the attack dynamics of the spruce bark beetle possible. Different information were used for instance inventory-data, registered spots of attacks on standing trees and results from pheromone-trap systems. Relations between stand structure typs (portion and the suitability of the host trees) and the attack on standing trees were shown. The distances from attacks in a year (n) to nearest attacks in the year before (n-1) were calculated with GIS. Different distances in the years 1997-2000 were discussed in relation to the population dynamic and the effectivity of prophylactic protection measures in single stands.},

Comparing EFISCEN simulations including the new bark beetle disturbance module against a 15-year damage time series for Austria showed good agreement at province level (R² between 0.496 and 0.802). A scenario analysis of climate change impacts on bark beetle-induced damages in Austria's Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.)

This classifier has become popular within the remote sensing community due to the accuracy of its classifications. The overall objective of this work was to review the utilization of RF classifier in remote sensing. This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},

abstract = {In recent years, the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, has impacted ? 8.9 million hectares of forests in the western United States. During endemic populations, trees weakened by other agents are often colonized by D. ponderosae but may be difficult to detect due to their scarcity. Once populations reach incipient levels, tree defenses are often insufficient in deterring mass attacks, and populations rapidly increase causing substantial levels of tree mortality under certain circumstances. There are two general approaches for reducing the negative impacts of D. ponderosae on forests. Direct control involves short-term tactics designed to address current infestations by manipulating beetle populations and includes the use of fire, insecticides, semiochemicals, sanitation harvests, or combinations of these treatments. Indirect control is preventive and designed to reduce the probability and severity of future infestations by manipulating stand, forest and/or landscape conditions by reducing the number of susceptible host trees through thinning, prescribed burning, and/or alterations of age classes and species composition. We review tree, stand, and landscape factors associated with D. ponderosae infestations and analyze the effectiveness of treatments for preventing and mitigating undesirable levels of tree mortality. We describe the current state of our knowledge and identify gaps for making informed management decisions.},

abstract = {In 2007, the mountain pine beetle impacted an estimated 10.1 million hectares of pine forest in British Columbia, Canada. Surveys to detect the location, size, and impact of infestations are conducted from field, airborne, and satellite perspectives. Importantly, the differing survey approaches characterize the infestation over dissimilar spatial scales (i.e., trees, stands, landscapes), and with varying levels of detection accuracy. In this communication, we provide background for understanding differing survey approaches, the nature of the information generated, the resultant detection accuracies that may be expected, and the link between survey accuracy and the ability to mitigate a given mountain pine beetle infestation. A detection accuracy of 100{\%} implies that all infested trees could be mitigated; however, no survey method achieves this level of detection accuracy, and therefore some residual infestation will persist, facilitating further population expansion if other environmental factors are conducive. Based upon this understanding, we model the number of years of mitigation effort required to maintain endemic beetle population levels, as a function of the survey approach used and the expected detection accuracy},

abstract = {Thinned and unthinned stands of lodgepole pine in eastern Oregon were evaluated in 1980 to determine their vigor and susceptibility to attack by outbreak populations of the mountain pine beetle. Application of a vigor rating system, based on amount of stem growth per square meter of crown leaf area, showed that thinnings from below improved vigor of residual stand and reduced beetle attack. Beetle mortality was significant in unthinned and lightly thinned stands where current annual growth of stemwood of residual trees averaged less than 80 g/m-' of foliage. Stands with mean vigor ratings of about 100 were beginning to suffer beetle attack. There was no mortality in heavily thinned stands where vigor ratings exceeded 120. These findings suggest that lodgepole pine can be managed through stocking control to obtain fast-growing, large-diameter trees and to avoid attack by the mountain pine beetle. FOREST SCI. 29:204-211. ADDITIONAL KEY WORDS. Pinus contorta, Dendroctonus ponderosae. MOUNTAIN PINE BEETLE (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) infestations in west-ern United States and Canada have been disastrous in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) stands in recent years (McCambridge and others 1979); and outbreaks have been recorded as long ago as 150 years (reference cited in Wellner 1978). Several chemical and cultural techniques have been tried to reduce damage, but most entomologists generally agree that silvicultural control is more promising (Safranyik and others 1974, Amman 1976, Klein 1978). Research in the Intermountain and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States and Canada have documented outbreak and endemic patterns of this pest for several years. It appears that once an outbreak begins, beetles select the largest trees in the stand, at low and middle elevations, and in stands 60 years old or older (Cole and Amman 1969, Roe and Amman 1970, Cole and others 1976). Outbreaks then accelerate because larger trees generally have thicker phloem and support more beetles per unit area of bark surface than trees with thin phloem (Amman 1972, Amman and Pace 1976, Berryman 1976, Klein and others 1978). Our observations suggest a similar pattern of beetle outbreaks in eastern Oregon.

abstract = {In mountainous environments with high relief, topography may cause cast shadows due to the blocking of direct solar radiation. Optical-infrared remote sensing images of these landscapes display reduced values of reflectance for shadowed areas compared to non-shadowed areas with similar surface cover characteristics. Different approaches to dealing with cast shadows are possible, although a common step in various active approaches is first to delineate the shadows using an automated algorithm and a digital elevation model. This article demonstrates a common confusion caused by cast shadows and describes a quantitative spatial evaluation of a cast shadow delineation algorithm in comparison to human interpretation of a Landsat TM image. it is shown that 86 percent of cast-shadow pixels were correctly marked by the algorithm. The causes of differences between the algorithm and human interpretation are discussed, and alternatives are considered for dealing with cast shadows in classification studies using optical-infrared images of mountainous terrain.},

Pheromone dispensers with different percentages of (4S)-cis-verbenol (cV) in pheromone mixtures were used. The results show that the different male catching efficiencies of pheromone trap barriers and single traps were related to the different percentages of cV in the pheromone bait. The proportions of males were higher in pheromone trap barriers than in single traps. Thus increasing the catch of males in pheromone trap barriers is possible by using a combination of pheromone traps containing pheromones giving a higher release of cV with others containing pheromones giving a lower release of cV.},

abstract = {Dendroecological techniques were used to examine the relationships between topographic aspects, climatic variation and radial growth of Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii Kom.) and Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) on the northeast Tibetan Plateau. Both tree species exhibit a lower growth rate, a larger interannual growth variability and a higher percentage of missing rings on the west- than east-facing slopes. The two tree-ring chronologies of the west-facing slope are positively correlated with monthly precipitation and relative air humidity, but negatively correlated with monthly maximum temperature in prior July-September and current May-June, suggesting a severe limitation of moisture availability on tree growth. On both topographic aspects, the two tree species show a significant and positive correlation with winter temperature. In comparison, the two tree-ring chronologies of the east-facing slope are positively related to July temperature. Interspecific differences in climatic responses can only be seen by a different strength of the climatic signal. Overall, the biophysical setting is critical in determining the nature of growth responses to climate. This study might provide useful information for looking forward in ecological forecasting of where and how possible future climate change will affect subalpine forests on the northeast Tibetan Plateau. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Winter mortality is an important driver in bark beetle population dynamics. Overwintering site - be it in the soil or within the tree - can influence mortality, because temperature dynamics can differ between soil and tree at the same site. For Ips typographus L. (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae), it is not yet definitely resolved which of the two aforementioned is its overwintering site. Both sites, sometimes even mixed within the same population, have been reported in earlier studies. Here we studied the underlying mechanism of soil overwintering in I. typographus. We used soil emergence traps at the base of infested trees with variable amounts of fallen bark during winter. The number of soil overwintering beetles increased with increasing amount of fallen bark and decreased with increasing distance from the stem base of infested trees. Removing the bark beneath soil emergence traps resulted in a smaller number of emerged beetles, indicating that a majority of beetles was located in the fallen bark and not in the litter. Thus, soil hibernation in our study area in Central Europe occurred passively, mediated through falling bark.Furthermore, we studied post-diapause fitness in terms of body weight and lipid reserves in dependence of overwintering site (tree vs. soil). Fresh and dry masses of beetles were higher before than after winter, but not different after winter between overwintering sites. Lipid reserves were more depleted in tree overwintering beetles. Thus, the soil seems to be more advantageous as overwintering site from an energetic point of view. However, both possible overwintering sites have different other advantages and mortality risks regarding onset of flight in spring, inoculative freezing, fungal infection or predation risk.The mixed overwintering sites, caused by individuals' active movement to the drier part of the bark and remaining in the stem or a passive dropping to the soil via fallen bark, spread winter mortality risks within populations and thus may contribute to local population stability. This phenomenon complicates forest management measures because a considerable number of beetles may be hibernating within fallen bark on the ground. Thus, when trees infested during the summer swarming period are not removed as long as bark is still in close contact with the stem, a great number of beetles can remain in the forest within fallen bark, even when trees are removed at a later point. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Determination of appropriate threshold levels for change/no-change identification is a critical factor that influences change detection result accuracy. The most used method to determine the threshold values is based on the standard deviation (SD) from the mean, assuming the amount of change (due to increase or decrease in brightness values) to be symmetrically distributed on a standard normal curve, which is not always true. Considering the asymmetrical nature of distribution histogram for the two sides, this study proposes a relatively simple and easy 'Independent Two-Step' thresholding approach for optimal threshold value determination for spectrally increased and decreased part using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) difference image. Six NDVI differencing images from 2007 to 2009 of different seasons were tested for inter-annual or seasonal land cover change/no-change identification.

abstract = {Accurate land cover information is required for science, monitoring, and reporting. Land cover changes naturally over time, as well as a result of anthropogenic activities. Monitoring and mapping of land cover and land cover change in a consistent and robust manner over large areas is made possible with Earth Observation (EO) data. Land cover products satisfying a range of science and policy information needs are currently produced periodically at different spatial and temporal scales. The increased availability of EO data-particularly from the Landsat archive (and soon to be augmented with Sentinel-2 data)-coupled with improved computing and storage capacity with novel image compositing approaches, have resulted in the availability of annual, large-area, gap-free, surface reflectance data products. In turn, these data products support the development of annual land cover products that can be both informed and constrained by change detection outputs. The inclusion of time series change in the land cover mapping process provides information on class stability and informs on logical class transitions (both temporally and categorically). In this review, we present the issues and opportunities associated with generating and validating time-series informed annual, large-area, land cover products, and identify methods suited to incorporating time series information and other novel inputs for land cover characterization.},

abstract = {Investigating spatio-temporal variations of species composition in grassland is an essential step in evaluating grassland health conditions, understanding the evolutionary processes of the local ecosystem, and developing grassland management strategies. Space-borne remote sensing images (e.g., MODIS, Landsat, and Quickbird) with spatial resolutions varying from less than 1 m to 500 m have been widely applied for vegetation species classification at spatial scales from community to regional levels. However, the spatial resolutions of these images are not fine enough to investigate grassland species composition, since grass species are generally small in size and highly mixed, and vegetation cover is greatly heterogeneous. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as an emerging remote sensing platform offers a unique ability to acquire imagery at very high spatial resolution (centimetres). Compared to satellites or airplanes, UAVs can be deployed quickly and repeatedly, and are less limited by weather conditions, facilitating advantageous temporal studies. In this study, we utilize an octocopter, on which we mounted a modified digital camera (with near-infrared (NIR), green, and blue bands), to investigate species composition in a tall grassland in Ontario, Canada. Seven flight missions were conducted during the growing season (April to December) in 2015 to detect seasonal variations, and four of them were selected in this study to investigate the spatio-temporal variations of species composition. To quantitatively compare images acquired at different times, we establish a processing flow of UAV-acquired imagery, focusing on imagery quality evaluation and radiometric correction. The corrected imagery is then applied to an object-based species classification. Maps of species distribution are subsequently used for a spatio-temporal change analysis. Results indicate that UAV-acquired imagery is an incomparable data source for studying fine-scale grassland species composition, owing to its high spatial resolution. The overall accuracy is around 85{\%} for images acquired at different times. Species composition is spatially attributed by topographical features and soil moisture conditions. Spatio-temporal variation of species composition implies the growing process and succession of different species, which is critical for understanding the evolutionary features of grassland ecosystems. Strengths and challenges of applying UAV-acquired imagery for vegetation studies are summarized at the end.},

A population of the eriophyid mite, Aceria salsolae (Acari: Eriophyidae), was collected in Greece and evaluated for host plant specificity as a prospective biological control agent. The mite usually does not form galls, but is a vagrant that usually inhabits the crevices of leaf and flower buds. Feeding damage causes meristematic tissue to die, which stunts the plant. The mite was able to multiply only on species in the Salsola section Kali subsection Kali, which includes the alien weeds Salsola collina, Salsola kali, and Salsola paulsenii. It did not damage or multiply on Salsola soda, which is in a different section, nor on Halogeton glomeratus, which is in the same tribe. The mite reduced the size of Russian thistle plants by 66{\%} at 25 weeks post-infestation under artificial conditions. The results indicate that the mite poses negligible risk to nontarget native North American plants or economic plants, and it may substantially reduce the size of Russian thistle plants and their population density.},

abstract = {Timely and accurate change detection of Earth's surface features is extremely important for understanding relationships and interactions between human and natural phenomena in order to promote better decision making. Remote sensing data are primary sources extensively used for change detection in recent decades. Many change detection techniques have been developed. This paper summarizes and reviews these techniques. Previous literature has shown that image differencing, principal component analysis and post-classification comparison are the most common methods used for change detection. In recent years, spectral mixture analysis, artificial neural networks and integration of geographical information system and remote sensing data have become important techniques for change detection applications. Different change detection algorithms have their own merits and no single approach is optimal and applicable to all cases. In practice, different algorithms are often compared to find the best change detection results for a specific application. Research of change detection techniques is still an active topic and new techniques are needed to effectively use the increasingly diverse and complex remotely sensed data available or projected to be soon available from satellite and airborne sensors. This paper is a comprehensive exploration of all the major change detection approaches implemented as found in the literature.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that areas with high concentrations of species tend to have high concentrations of human activities. Would this tendency be altered with projected environmental changes? We investigate this possibility using the most extensive available dataset on species distributions in Europe, providing data for 3143 species. Observed land uses were utilised to generate three indicators of anthropogenic 'pressure' for 1971-2000: urbanisation, cropland and grassland use intensities. Storylines describing alternative development pathways were used to create four land-use scenarios for 2021-2050. Exposure of biodiversity to human activities was measured as changes in the degree of pressure recorded in hypothetical reserve networks selected to maximize the representation of plant, breeding bird, mammal, amphibian, and reptile species. In all socio-economic scenarios there was a tendency for increasing urbanisation and decreasing cropland intensities within selected conservation areas. Pressures arising from increasing grassland use were variable across scenarios and taxa. Our results challenge the idea that a single development strategy might provide reduced impacts in all regions and taxonomic groups. We show that impacts are likely to be complex and that tradeoffs might exist among development strategies. Nevertheless, results are contingent on the data, scale, and type of analyses conducted and further research is required to assess the impacts of alternative human-development scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The availability of suitable climate space across Europe for the distributions of 47 species chosen to encompass a range of taxa (including plants, insects, birds and mammals) and to reflect dominant and threatened species from 10 habitats was modelled for the current climate and three climate change scenarios using the SPECIES neural network model. The present European distribution was satisfactorily simulated for 45 species, which showed good statistics of fit between observed species' distributions and derived models. The predicted responses to climate change demonstrate that the distribution of many species in Europe may be affected by climate change, but that the effects are likely to differ between species. The general pattern is of a south-west to north-east shift in suitable climate space, with gains balancing losses for many species. Based on the total change in potential climate space in Europe, the species most sensitive to climate change were Rubus chamaemorus (Cloudberry; negatively affected) and Genista acanthoclada (Hairy greenweed; positively affected). This disparity in species' response has important implications for EU biodiversity policy as the significance of different countries changes in terms of their future contribution to the conservation of habitats and species. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Climate-related extended outbreaks and range shifts of destructive bark beetle species pose a serious threat to urban boreal forests in North America and Fennoscandia. Recent developments in low-cost remote sensing technologies offer an attractive means for early detection and management of environmental change. They are of great interest to the actors responsible for monitoring and managing forest health. The objective of this investigation was to develop, assess, and compare automated remote sensing procedures based on novel, low-cost hyperspectral imaging technology for the identification of bark beetle infestations at the individual tree level in urban forests. A hyperspectral camera based on a tunable Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot interferometer was operated from a small, unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) platform and a small Cessna-type aircraft platform. This study compared aspects of using UAV datasets with a spatial extent of a few hectares (ha) and a ground sample distance (GSD) of 10–12 cm to the aircraft data covering areas of several km2and having a GSD of 50 cm. An empirical assessment of the automated identification of mature Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) trees suffering from infestation (representing different colonization phases) by the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) was carried out in the urban forests of Lahti, a city in southern Finland. Individual spruces were classified as healthy, infested, or dead. For the entire test area, the best aircraft data results for overall accuracy were 79{\%} (Cohen's kappa: 0.54) when using three crown color classes (green as healthy, yellow as infested, and gray as dead). For two color classes (healthy, dead) in the same area, the best overall accuracy was 93{\%} (kappa: 0.77). The finer resolution UAV dataset provided better results, with an overall accuracy of 81{\%} (kappa: 0.70), compared to the aircraft results of 73{\%} (kappa: 0.56) in a smaller sub-area. The results showed that novel, low-cost remote sensing technologies based on individual tree analysis and calibrated remote sensing imagery offer great potential for affordable and timely assessments of the health condition of vulnerable urban forests.},

abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services (ES) are widely debated. However, it is still not clear how biodiversity conservation and ES interact with different strategies in and surrounding protected areas (PAs), the cornerstone for biodiversity conservation. Here, we present results on the interplay between biodiversity conservation and nature-based tourism (a cultural ES), while controlling for environmental and socioeconomic factors in and surrounding terrestrial PAs worldwide. Results indicate that nature-based tourism is more frequent in PAs that are of higher biodiversity, older, larger, more accessible from urban areas and at higher elevation. High population density surrounding PAs and national income levels are also major socioeconomic factors related to nature-based tourism. Furthermore, PAs managed mainly for biodiversity conservation have nearly 35{\%} more visitors than those managed for mixed use. Strict management for biodiversity is also associated with increased biodiversity. These results show the importance of biodiversity in addressing nature-based tourism and suggest this interrelationship could be altered by different management strategies used by PAs.},

These characteristics were used as explanatory variables in ordination analyses. The major change in species assemblages occurred with the progression in wood decay, but the composition of fungi was also associated with other variables, including the cause of tree death. Red-listed species were found mostly on logs in the middle to late stages of decay, originating from trees that died due to various causes.

abstract = {In this study, forest cover change and urbanization in the borders of Regional Directorate of Trabzon Forestry (RDTF), which is located in NE of Turkey, was investigated during a 25 year period. Spatial and temporal changes in forest cover were also analyzed using Geographical Information System (GIS) and FRAGSTATS. Forest cover changes were detected from a time series of satellite images of Landsat MSS in 1975, Landsat TM in 1987, and Landsat ETM+ in 2000 using Remote Sensing (RS) and GIS. The results showed a decrease in forest area, productive forest area and degraded forest area. Total forest area decreased in the first period (1975--1987), however increased during the second (1987--2000) period. 36,807 hectares (7{\%} of the study area) mixed forest area converted to conifer forest. During the whole study period, the average annual deforestation rate was 977 ha year(-1), equivalent to 0.42{\%} year(-1) using the compound-interest-rate formula. Total number of forest fragments decreased from 135,039 to 132,839 (1.6{\%}) during a 25 year period. On the other hand, total population lived in the borders of Trabzon City increased from 1975 to 2000 even though the rural population decreased. According to the results, the decrease of forest areas may well be explained by increasing population and urbanization. The decrease of number of patches and degraded forest area can be disclosed by the fact that the decline of rural population has positively affected the development of forest areas.},

To this end, we first examine the goals of effectiveness monitoring and introduce a general classification system to clarify the purpose and practice of efficacy monitoring. Based on these principles, the review is then structured around effectiveness evaluations for managing forest pests, primarily Mountain, Southern (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann), and Western Pine Beetles (Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte) throughout North America, and grouped by management strategy: silvicultural treatments; prescribed burns; and the use of attractants, repellants and insecticides. Finally, we propose the use of remotely sensed data as a complementary tool for monitoring changes in the extent and severity of Mountain Pine Beetle damage across large areas. Use of such data enables assessment of the efficacy of landscape level management practices, directing the application of new mitigation activities, and reducing the risk of future infestations.},

abstract = {Weed control is commonly performed by applying selective herbicides homogeneously over entire agricultural fields. However, applying herbicide only where needed could have economical and environmental benefits. The objective of this study was to apply remote sensing to the detection of grasses and broadleaf weeds among cereal and broadleaf crops. Spectral relative reflectance values at both leaf and canopy scales were obtained by field spectroscopy for four plant categories: wheat, chickpea, grass weeds, and broadleaf weeds. Total reflectance spectra of leaf tissues for botanical genera were successfully classified by general discriminant analysis (GDA). The total canopy spec- tral classification by GDA for specific narrow bands was 95 ± 4.19{\%} for wheat and 94 ± 5.13{\%} for chickpea. The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for future Vegetation and Environmental Monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VEN $\mu$ S) bands was 77 ± 8.09{\%} for wheat and 88 ± 6.94{\%} for chickpea, and for the operative satellite Advanced Land Imager (ALI) bands was 78 ± 7.97{\%} for wheat and 82 ± 8.22{\%} for chickpea. Within the critical period for weed control, an overall classification accuracy of 87 ± 5.57{\%} was achieved for {\textgreater} 5{\%} vegetation coverage in a wheat field, thereby providing potential for implementation of herbicide applications. Qualitative models based on wheat, chickpea, grass weed, and broadleaf weed spectral properties have high-quality classification and prediction potential that can be used for site-specific weed management.},

abstract = {The exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) dominates vast acreages of rangeland in the western USA, leading to increased fire frequency and ecosystem degradation that is often irreversible. Episodic regeneration failure (“die-off”) has been observed in cheatgrass monocultures and can have negative ecosystem consequences, but can also provide an opportunity for restoration of native species and ecological function within the imperiled sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Proximate causes of cheatgrass die-off are uncertain, although several taxa of fungal soil pathogens have been implicated. Die-off occurrence is stochastic and can occur in remote areas. Thus, developing remote sensing indicators that are repeatable over long time periods, across extensive regions, and at relatively fine spatial resolution would be beneficial for accurately pinpointing events. We developed a remote sensing approach for mapping historical die-off from the Landsat archive (1985–2015), and used this to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of die-off occurrence annually at 30-m resolution. A Random Forests classification of image-derived spectral endmembers, trained on 2014 data, predicted die-off with 93{\%} accuracy ($\kappa$ = 0.845) when applied to independent validation data from 2009. Die-off extent varied greatly across years, though some areas experienced die-off multiple times during the observation period. We found a strong correspondence between die-off occurrence and winter drought conditions, with strongest negative associations with current-year winter precipitation and previous years' lagged winter and annual precipitation. Die-off duration was heavily skewed towards single-year die-off (81.5{\%} of events), even in localized areas of more frequent occurrence (‘die-off hotspots'). Our retrospective classification of the Landsat archive suggests that cheatgrass die-off occurrence is predictable as the intersection of particular site environmental conditions with annual weather conditions, possibly because they are favorable for disease expression. Associations with previous year conditions suggest that die-off may also depend upon feedbacks between cheatgrass dominance and litter production, suitable sites for seedling establishment, and abundance and persistence of pathogen inoculum. Remote sensing indicators such as those developed in this study are needed to develop hypotheses about die-off causal factors, as well as support improved management of cheatgrass, mitigation for negative consequences associated with die-off (e.g. wind erosion), and successful restoration of native plant communities on die-off areas.},

abstract = {Water-limited ecosystems often recover slowly following anthropogenic or natural disturbance. Multitemporal remote sensing can be used to monitor ecosystem recovery after disturbance; however, dryland vegetation cover can be challenging to accurately measure due to sparse cover and spectral confusion between soils and non-photosynthetic vegetation. With the goal of optimizing a monitoring approach for identifying both abrupt and gradual vegetation changes, we evaluated the ability of Landsat-derived spectral variables to characterize surface variability of vegetation cover and bare ground across a range of vegetation community types. Using three year composites of Landsat data, we modeled relationships between spectral information and field data collected at monitoring sites near Canyonlands National Park, UT. We also developed multiple regression models to assess improvement over single variables. We found that for all vegetation types, percent cover bare ground could be accurately modeled with single indices that included a combination of red and shortwave infrared bands, while near infrared-based vegetation indices like NDVI worked best for quantifying tree cover and total live vegetation cover in woodlands. We applied four models to characterize the spatial distribution of putative grassland ecological states across our study area, illustrating how this approach can be implemented to guide dryland ecosystem management.},

abstract = {AbstrAct At the end of 2013, strong wind destroyed spruce stands on large areas of Ko{\'{s}}cieliska Valley in Tatra Mts. in Poland. In 2015–2017, 304 bark samples were collected from 106 spruces; 25 cm × 25 cm large samples were taken from 2 or 4 sections of infested trees in July/August each year. The infestation density, sex ratio, length of maternal galleries, number of progeny and impact of natural enemies were recorded. The infestation density in individual years was 0.79–0.86 mating chambers per dm 2 , the average length of maternal gallery (55.2–56.6 mm) did not differ between years, The average number of progeny per female from 3-year pooled data was 18.22, the highest in 2015 (27.4) then collapsed to 15.5–16.8. The gallery systems with 2 females, in which the reproduc-tion success was the highest, dominated (62.6{\%}). The frequency of parasitoids or entomopathogens was very low (2–20{\%} mortality rate in 19 bark samples). Possible reasons of relatively low reproduction success regardless generally favourable breeding conditions and its collapse after first year, such as high infestation density and low survival rate of larvae because of climatic conditions (drought), are discussed. Taking into account the described population features, very intense tree mortality and mechanisms known from the other wind events, further de-velopment of the outbreak can be expected in this area.},

abstract = {In spite of the high importance of forests, global forest loss has remained alarmingly high during the last decades. Forest loss at a global scale has been unveiled with increasingly finer spatial resolution, but the forest extent and loss in protected areas (PAs) and in large intact forest landscapes (IFLs) have not so far been systematically assessed. Moreover, the impact of protection on preserving the IFLs is not well understood. In this study we conducted a consistent assessment of the global forest loss in PAs and IFLs over the period 2000-2012. We used recently published global remote sensing based spatial forest cover change data, being a uniform and consistent dataset over space and time, together with global datasets on PAs' and IFLs' locations. Our analyses revealed that on a global scale 3{\%} of the protected forest, 2.5{\%} of the intact forest, and 1.5{\%} of the protected intact forest were lost during the study period. These forest loss rates are relatively high compared to global total forest loss of 5{\%} for the same time period. The variation in forest losses and in protection effect was large among geographical regions and countries. In some regions the loss in protected forests exceeded 5{\%} (e.g. in Australia and Oceania, and North America) and the relative forest loss was higher inside protected areas than outside those areas (e.g. in Mongolia and parts of Africa, Central Asia, and Europe). At the same time, protection was found to prevent forest loss in several countries (e.g. in South America and Southeast Asia). Globally, high area-weighted forest loss rates of protected and intact forests were associated with high gross domestic product and in the case of protected forests also with high proportions of agricultural land. Our findings reinforce the need for improved understanding of the reasons for the high forest losses in PAs and IFLs and strategies to prevent further losses.},

abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing has been under attack in recent years, partly owing to the arbitrary nature of setting $\alpha$ (the decision-making threshold and probability of Type I error) at a constant value, usually 0.05. If the goal of null hypothesis testing is to present conclusions in which we have the highest possible confidence, then the only logical decision-making threshold is the value that minimizes the probability (or occasionally, cost) of making errors. Setting $\alpha$ to minimize the combination of Type I and Type II error at a critical effect size can easily be accomplished for traditional statistical tests by calculating the $\alpha$ associated with the minimum average of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ at the critical effect size. This technique also has the flexibility to incorporate prior probabilities of null and alternate hypotheses and/or relative costs of Type I and Type II errors, if known. Using an optimal $\alpha$ results in stronger scientific inferences because it estimates and minimizes both Type I errors and relevant Type II errors for a test. It also results in greater transparency concerning assumptions about relevant effect size(s) and the relative costs of Type I and II errors. By contrast, the use of $\alpha$ = 0.05 results in arbitrary decisions about what effect sizes will likely be considered significant, if real, and results in arbitrary amounts of Type II error for meaningful potential effect sizes. We cannot identify a rationale for continuing to arbitrarily use $\alpha$ = 0.05 for null hypothesis significance tests in any field, when it is possible to determine an optimal $\alpha$.},

abstract = {The spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), is one of the most destructive insects infesting spruce forests in Europe. Data concerning infestations of I. typographus occurring over the last 19 years (1994–2012) on the Southern Alps were analyzed in seven spruce forest types: (1) pure spruce plantations; (2) pure spruce reforestations; (3) pure spruce mountain forests; (4) pure spruce alpine forests; (5) spruce-conifer mixed forests; (6) spruce-broadleaf mixed forests; and (7) spruce-conifer-broadleaf mixed forests. The collected data included the amount of I. typographus damage and the location and composition of the infested forests. The results indicate that different forest types are differently susceptible to I. typographus. Plantations, reforestations and mountain spruce forests show mean damage and mean number of infestations higher than other forest types. Within pure spruce forests, alpine forests growing at high elevations ({\textgreater}1300 m) suffer low damage. Furthermore, the mean number of infestation spots recorded annually in the different spruce forest types is negatively correlated with a Naturality Index value. The results suggest that forest composition and elevation are the main factors driving the risk of I. typographus damage. A new management strategy for some spruce forest types is needed, with a progressive reduction of pure spruce forests at low altitude and an increase of broadleaf composition.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an economically important crop that is highly susceptible to cotton root rot. Remote sensing technology provides a useful and effective means for detecting and mapping cotton root rot infestations in cotton fields. This research assessed the potential of 10-m Sentinel-2A satellite imagery for cotton root rot detection and compared it with airborne multispectral imagery using unsupervised classification at both field and regional levels. Accuracy assessment showed that the classification maps from the Sentinel-2A imagery had an overall accuracy of 94.1{\%} for field subset images and 91.2{\%} for the whole image, compared with the airborne image classification results. However, some small cotton root rot areas were undetectable and some non-infested areas within large root rot areas were incorrectly classified as infested due to the images' coarse spatial resolution. Classification maps based on field subset Sentinel-2A images missed 16.6{\%} of the infested areas and the classification map based on the whole Sentinel-2A image for the study area omitted 19.7{\%} of the infested areas. These results demonstrate that freely-available Sentinel-2 imagery can be used as an alternative data source for identifying cotton root rot and creating prescription maps for site-specific management of the disease.},

Many studies have shown the interest of recent satellite missions as suitable tools for agricultural surveys. Nevertheless, they are not predictive methods. A system able to detect summer crops as early as possible is important in order to obtain valuable information for a better water management strategy. The detection of summer crops before the beginning of the irrigation period is therefore our objective. The study area is located near Toulouse (southwestern France), and is a region of mixed farming with a wide variety of irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Using the reference data for the years concerned, a set of fixed thresholds are applied to a vegetation index (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) for each agricultural season of multi-spectral satellite optical imagery acquired at decametric spatial resolutions from 2006 to 2013. The performance (i.e., accuracy) is contrasted according to the agricultural practices, the development states of the different crops and the number of acquisition dates (one to three in the results presented here). The detection of summer crops reaches 64{\%} to 88{\%} with a single date, 80{\%} to 88{\%} with two dates and 90{\%} to 99{\%} with three dates. The robustness of this method is tested for several years (showing an impact of meteorological conditions on the actual choice of images), several sensors and several resolutions.},

The use of remote sensing for accurate mapping invasion extent and pattern offers several advantages, including repeatability, large area coverage, complete instead of sub-sampled assessments and greater cost-effectiveness over ground-based methods. It is critical for locating, early mapping and controlling small infestations before they reach economically prohibitive or ecologically significant levels over larger land areas. This study was designed to explore the ability of hyperspectral imagery for mapping infestation of musk thistle (Carduus nutans) on a native grassland during the preflowering stage in mid-April and during the peak flowering stage in mid-June using the support vector machine classifier and to assess and compare the resulting mapping accuracy for these two distinctive phenological stages. Accuracy assessment revealed that the overall accuracies were 79{\%} and 91{\%} for the classified images at preflowering and peak flowering stages, respectively. These results indicate that repeated detection of the infestation extent, as well as infestation severity or intensity, of this noxious weed in a spatial and temporal context is possible using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery.},

abstract = {Juniper trees are widely distributed throughout the world and are common sources of allergies when microscopic pollen grains are transported by wind and inhaled. In this study, we investigated the spectral influences of pollen-discharging male juniper cones within a juniper canopy. This was done through a controlled outdoor experiment involving ASD FieldSpec Pro Spectroradiometer measurements over juniper canopies of varying cone densities. Broadband and narrowband spectral reflectance and vegetation index (VI) patterns were evaluated as to their sensitivity and their ability to discriminate the presence of cones. The overall aim of this research was to assess remotely sensed phenological capabilities to detect pollen-bearing juniper trees for public health applications. A general decrease in reflectance values with increasing juniper cone density was found, particularly in the Green (545–565 nm) and NIR (750–1,350 nm) regions. In contrast, reflectances in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 2,000 nm to 2,350 nm) region decreased from no cone presence to intermediate amounts (90 g/m2) and then increased from intermediate levels to the highest cone densities (200 g/m2). Reflectance patterns in the Red (620–700 nm) were more complex due to shifting contrast patterns in absorptance between cones and juniper foliage, where juniper foliage is more absorbing than cones only within the intense narrowband region of maximum chlorophyll absorption near 680 nm. Overall, narrowband reflectances were more sensitive to cone density changes than the equivalent MODIS broadbands. In all VIs analyzed, there were significant relationships with cone density levels, particularly with the narrowband versions and the two-band vegetation index (TBVI) based on Green and Red bands, a promising outcome for the use of phenocams in juniper phenology trait studies. These results indicate that spectral indices are sensitive to certain juniper phenologic traits that can potentially be used for juniper cone detection in support of public health applications.},

abstract = {Mountain pine beetle infestations are spatially correlated; current (green) attack is often located near previous (red) attack. This spatial correlation between the green and red attack stages enables operational survey methods, as detection of red attack trees—typically from an airborne survey such as a helicopter GPS survey or aerial photography—guides the location of subsequent ground surveys for green attack trees. Forest managers, in an attempt to understand beetle movement and infestation patterns, hope to utilize remotely sensed data to detect and map green attack trees, with the expectation that the spatial extent, accuracy, and timeliness afforded by remotely sensed data will greatly improve the efficacy of bee- tle treatment and control. In this communication, we present the biological, logistical, and technological factors that limit the operational utility of remotely sensed data for green attack detection and mapping. To provide context for these lim- itations, we identify the operational information needs associated with green attack and discuss how these requirements dictate the characteristics of any potential remotely sensed data source (e.g., spatial, spectral, and temporal characteris- tics). Based upon our assessment, we conclude that the remote detection of green attack is not operationally viable, and is unlikely to become so unless the limiting factors we have identified are altered substantially or removed.},

Accurate and up-to-date assessment of the spatial distribution of rice cultivated area is a key information requirement of all stakeholders including policy makers, rice farmers and consumers. Timely assessment with high precision is, e.g., crucial for water resource management, market prices control and during humanitarian food crisis. Recently, two Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellites carrying a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor were launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) within the homework of the Copernicus program. The advanced data acquisition capabilities of S-1 provide a unique opportunity to monitor different land cover types at high spatial (20 m) and temporal (twice-weekly to biweekly) resolution. The objective of this research is to evaluate the applicability of an existing phenology-based classification method for continental-scale rice cropland mapping using S-1 backscatter time series. In this study, the S-1 images were collected during the rice growing season of 2015 covering eight selected European test sites situated in six Mediterranean countries. Due to the better rice classification capabilities of SAR cross-polarized measurement as compared to co-polarized data, S-1 cross-polarized (VH) data were used. Phenological parameters derived from the S-1 VH backscatter time series were used as an input to a knowledge-based decision-rule classifier in order to classify the input data into rice and non-rice areas. The classification results were evaluated using multiple regions of interest (ROIs) drawn from high-resolution optical remote sensing (SPOT 5) data and the European CORINE land cover (CLC 2012) product. An overall accuracy of more than 70{\%} for all eight study sites was achieved. The S-1 based classification maps reveal much more details compared to the rice field class contained in the CLC 2012 product. These findings demonstrate the potential and feasibility of using S-1 VH data to develop an operational rice crop monitoring framework at the continental scale.},

abstract = {The characterization of vegetation is a very important ecological task, especially in sensitive mountain areas, as alpine regions often respond to small short-term variations of abiotic and biotic com- ponents as well as long-term global changes. Spatial techniques, such as imaging spectroscopy, allow for detailed classification of different syntaxonomic categories of vegetation and their status. Based on the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) and simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data, this study focused on subalpine and alpine vegetation mapping in the eastern part of the Polish Karkonosze National Park (KPN). The spatial resolution of APEX (3.12 m) enabled the classification of 21 vegetation communities, which was generalized into eight vegetation types. These types were identified on scaled-up APEX data, as both 252 bands from most of the spectral range and a spectrally reduced dataset of 30 minimum noise fraction (MNF) transforms, and compared to the simulated (30 m spatial resolu- tion) EnMAP data using test areas extracted from the field survey derived reference non-forest vegetation map. After preprocessing, a pixel purity index (PPI) was calculated using the MNF image and then the training and validation pixels were selected with Support Vector Machine classification of vegetation communities carried out using different kernel functions: linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid. The classification accuracy was obtained for 21 base classes, and the best result was achieved by using the linear function and 252 bands (overall accuracy (OA) of 74.39{\%}). The next step was to classify the eight generalized vegetation types, and the OA for the APEX data reached 90.72{\%} while EnMAP reached 78.25{\%}. The results show the potential use of APEX and EnMAP imagery in mapping subalpine and alpine vege- tation on a community and vegetation-type scales, within a diverse ecosystem such as the Karkonosze National Park.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Kochia (Kochia scoparia L.), Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.), and prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.) are economically important weeds infesting dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production systems in the western United States. Those weeds produce most of their seeds post-harvest. The objectives of this study were to determine the ability of an optical sensor, installed for on-the-go measurement of grain protein concentration, to detect the presence of green plant matter in flowing grain and assess the potential usefulness of this information for mapping weeds at harvest. Spectra of the grain stream were recorded continuously at a rate of 0.33 Hz during harvest of two spring wheat fields of 1.9 and 5.4 ha. All readings were georeferenced using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with 1 m positional accuracy. Chlorophyll of green plant matter was detectable in the red (638–710 nm) waveband. Maps of the chlorophyll signal from both fields showed an overall agreement of 78.1{\%} with reference maps, one constructed prior to harvest and the other at harvest time, both based on visual evaluations of the three green weed species conducted by experts. Information on weed distributions at harvest may be useful for controlling post-harvest using variable rate technology for herbicide applications.},

abstract = {Laboratory spectroscopy in visible and infrared regions is an important tool for studies dealing with plant ecophysiology and early recognition of plant stress due to changing environmental conditions. Leaf optical properties are typically acquired with a spectroradiometer coupled with an integration sphere (IS) in a laboratory or with a contact probe (CP), which has the advantage of operating flexibility and the provision of repetitive in-situ reflectance measurements. Experiments comparing reflectance spectra measured with different devices and device settings are rarely reported in literature. Thus, in our study we focused on a comparison of spectra collected with two ISs on identical samples ranging from a Spectralon and coloured papers as reference standards to vegetation samples with broadleaved (Nicotiana Rustica L.) and coniferous (Picea abies L. Karst.) leaf types. First, statistical measures such as mean absolute difference, median of differences, standard deviation and paired-sample t-test were applied in order to evaluate differences between collected reflectance values. The possibility of linear transformation between spectra was also tested. Moreover, correlation between normalised differential indexes (NDI) derived for each device and all combinations of wavelengths between 450 nm and 1800 nm were assessed. Finally, relationships between laboratory measured leaf compounds (total chlorophyll, carotenoids and water content), NDI and selected spectral indices often used in remote sensing were studied. The results showed differences between spectra acquired with different devices. While differences were negligible in the case of the Spectralon and they were possible to be modelled with a linear transformation in the case of coloured papers, the spectra collected with the CP and the ISs differed significantly in the case of vegetation samples. Regarding the spectral indices calculated from the reflectance data collected with the three devices, their mean values were in the range of the corresponding standard deviations in the case of broadleaved leaf type. Larger differences in optical leaf properties of spruce needles collected with the CP and ISs are implicated from the different measurement procedure due to needle-like leaf where shoots with spatially oriented needles were measured with the CP and individual needles with the IS. The study shows that a direct comparison between the spectra collected with two devices is not advisable as spectrally dependent offsets may likely exist. We propose that the future studies shall focus on standardisation of measurement procedures so that open access spectral libraries could serve as a reliable input for modelling of optical properties on a leaf level.},

abstract = {Succession of Carabidae communities in spruce forests in the High Tatra Mts damaged by the windstorm of November 2004 exhibited two trends. The first trend includes the communities differentiation according to the state and management of damaged sites into three groups: (1) the site with fallen timber in situ shows only quantitative and reversible changes in rapport to the intact stand, (2) the sites with extracted timber, where less tolerant forest species disappeared, more tolerant forest species were favored and non-forest mountain species appeared, (3) the sites with extracted timber, additionally burned in July/August 2005, where number of the forest species and their abundance declined and temporal invasions of xenocoenous open-landscape species occurred. This differentiation is explained by autecology of individual species and state of vegetation. In 2010, the communities in burned and unburned sites started to converge due to partial restoration of the vegetation cover, but they continued to strongly differ from the site with timber in situ. The second trend includes a striking decline of the number of species and individuals and cumulative biomass in all sites in 2008 and a slow increase of these parameters up to 2011. The extreme dry summer of 2012 caused a decline of these parameters about to the levels from 2009. This trend represents a long lasting consequence of the extremely dry year 2007 and an immediate response to the drought in 2012. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI24) and Standardized Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI24) fitted best these changes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

Based on the models developed in this study, a positive correlation was found between the foliage area of spruce branches and the densities infested by P. chalcographus and D. autographus, though a higher negative correlation was found in relation to the size of the branch bark area (BA) and the infestation densities. A negative correlation for the branch BA was also found on P. pityographus. This result shows that the desiccation of branches affects the infestation densities of bark beetles. In contrast, the size of the branch BA was positively correlated with the reproductive efficiency of P. chalcographus, with higher reproductive efficiency on the branches from the outer layer of the pile than on disorderly scattered branches on the ground.},

abstract = {Bark beetle populations may undergo dramatic fluctuations and are often important pests in coniferous forests. Their dynamics are thought to be primarily driven by factors affecting the resistance of the host tree to attack, i.e., bottom-up forces, while natural enemies are usually assigned a minor role in these systems. I present behavioral experiments that suggest that the clerid beetle Thanasimus dubius may be an important source of mortality for the bark beetle Dendroctonus frontalis during attack of the host tree, and determine the nature of the functional response of T. dubius under conditions close to natural. I also examine the numerical response of T. dubius to large-scale fluctuations in D. frontalis density, and the relationship between bark beetle population trends and predator density, and find that beetle populations tend to decline when predator densities are high. Combined with the effects of clerid larvae on bark beetle broods, these results suggest that top-down forces generated by natural enemies could also be an important component of bark beetle dynamics. The implications of these results for bark beetle dynamics are discussed in relation to the prolonged life-cycle of clerid beetles.},

Infestation was controlled experimentally using a novel ‘attack box' method. * Treatments influenced the ratios of successful and defended attacks, but predisposition of trees to infestation appeared to be mainly driven by variations in stress status of the individual trees over time. With increasingly negative twig water potentials and decreasing resin exudation, the defence capability of the spruce trees decreased. * We provide empirical evidence that water-limiting conditions impair Norway spruce resistance to bark beetle attack.

abstract = {In order to map the spatial distribution of twenty tree species groups over Europe at 1 km √{\'{o}} 1 km resolution, the ICP-Forest Level-I plot data were extended with the National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot data of eighteen countries. The NFI grids have a much smaller spacing than the ICP grid. In areas with NFI plot data, the proportions of the land area covered by the tree species were mapped by compositional kriging. Outside these areas, these proportions were mapped with a multinomial multiple logistic regression model. A soil map, a biogeographical map and bioindicators derived from temperature and precipitation data were used as predictors. Both methods ensure that the predicted proportions are in the interval [0,1] and sum to 1. The regression predictions were iteratively scaled to the National Forest Inventory statistics and the Forest map of Europe. The predicted proportions for the twenty tree species were validated by the Bhattacharryya distance between predicted and observed proportions at 230 plot data separated from the calibration data. Besides, the map with the predicted dominant species was validated by computing the error matrix. The median Bhattacharryya distance in the subarea with NFI plot data was 1.712, whereas in the subarea with ICP-Level-I data, this was 2.131. The scaling did not significantly decrease the Bhattacharryya distance. The estimated overall accuracy of this map was 43{\%}. In areas with NFI plot data, overall accuracy was 57{\%}, outside these areas 33{\%}. This gain was mainly attributable to the much denser plot data, less to the prediction method.},

abstract = {Secondary attraction to aggregation pheromones plays a central role in the host colonization behavior of the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. However, it is largely unknown how the beetles pioneering an attack locate suitable host trees, and eventually accept or reject them. To find possible biomarkers for host choice by I. typographus, we analyzed the chemistry of 58 Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees that were subsequently either (1) successfully attacked and killed, (2) unsuccessfully attacked, or (3) left unattacked. The trees were sampled before the main beetle flight in a natural Norway spruce-dominated forest. No pheromones were used to attract beetles to the experimental trees. To test the trees' defense potential, each tree was treated in a local area with the defense hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJ), and treated and untreated bark were analyzed for 66 different compounds, including terpenes, phenolics and alkaloids. The chemistry of MeJ-treated bark correlated strongly with the success of I. typographus attack, revealing major chemical differences between killed trees and unsuccessfully attacked trees. Surviving trees produced significantly higher amounts of most of the 39 analyzed mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes and of 4 of 20 phenolics. Alkaloids showed no clear pattern. Differences in untreated bark were less pronounced, where only 1,8-cineole and (-)-limonene were significantly higher in unsuccessfully attacked trees. Our results show that the potential of individual P. abies trees for inducing defense compounds upon I. typographus attack may partly determine tree resistance to this bark beetle by inhibiting its mass attack.},

abstract = {Forest pest insects may cause large-scale tree growth reductions and tree mortality during outbreaks. The large-scale development of outbreaks has frequently been studied, while the colonization-extinction dynamics during outbreaks is less known. We study the colonization-extinction dynamics of a severe tree-killing bark beetle, Ips typographus, during an outbreak across a 130000ha forest landscape in southern Sweden. We recorded annual colonization and extinction events in 1ha pixels across the landscape by helicopter surveys during three consecutive years, and modeled colonization and extinction probabilities based on focal pixel quality, local population size, connectivity to surrounding beetle populations, and tree composition in the surrounding landscape. The local populations had a high turnover; 81-93{\%} of all occupied pixels were the result of colonizations in the same year and the annual extinction rates were 84-90{\%}. The colonization probability increased and the extinction probability decreased with increasing spruce (host-tree) volume in focal pixels and the connectivity. The fitted spatial scaling parameter of the connectivity measure suggested that the colonization probability was mainly affected by the number of surrounding occupied pixels within a few hundred meters. The colonization probability also decreased with increasing volume of birch (a nonhost) in the focal pixel, while the extinction probability decreased with increasing local population size. In conclusion, the local population size and quality of the focal pixel explained more of the colonization and extinction probability than the connectivity and composition of surrounding forest. The distribution of tree-killing bark beetles during outbreaks can be patchy and highly dynamic. Two reasons for this are the increased probability of successful attacks when exceeding a critical attack density and the fragmented distribution of large spruce volumes throughout the forest landscape.},

However, our understanding of disturbance dynamics in response to climatic changes remains incomplete, particularly regarding large-scale patterns, interaction effects and dampening feedbacks. Here we provide a global synthesis of climate change effects on important abiotic (fire, drought, wind, snow and ice) and biotic (insects and pathogens) disturbance agents. Warmer and drier conditions particularly facilitate fire, drought and insect disturbances, while warmer and wetter conditions increase disturbances from wind and pathogens. Widespread interactions between agents are likely to amplify disturbances, while indirect climate effects such as vegetation changes can dampen long-term disturbance sensitivities to climate. Future changes in disturbance are likely to be most pronounced in coniferous forests and the boreal biome. We conclude that both ecosystems and society should be prepared for an increasingly disturbed future of forests.},

The course of the timberline ecotone in both valleys is similar. In both valleys, the stable timberline section is almost half of the total timberline length. In both valleys there has been an increase in the elevation of the timberline (on average by 10 m in the Mengusovsk{\'{a}} Valley and 15 m in the Rybi Potok Valley), and free spaces have been increasingly closing up. The progressive changes of the timberline are mainly due to the limit placed on human economic activity, and to climate warming. Inactive avalanche paths have led to an enlargement of the forest area in both valleys. The reduction of avalanche activity is the direct result of climate warming in the Tatra Mts. and from the decrease in the amount of snow in winters.},

abstract = {Bark beetle infestation impacts the health of coniferous forests, which are an important source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the atmosphere. The types and amounts of VOCs emitted from forests can influence secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and impact overall air quality. In this initial work, the impact of bark beetle infestation on SOA precursors from Engelmann spruce is assessed. The VOCs emitted from the trunk of infested and healthy spruce trees were sampled using both sorbent traps and evacuated canisters that were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The samples from the infested spruce tree suggest a nine-fold enhancement in the total VOC emissions. The dominant VOCs in the infested spruce trees were 3-carene, $\beta$-pinene, and $\alpha$-pinene. The increase observed in VOCs sampled at the trunk of the infested spruce was consistent with increases observed at infested lodgepole pine trunks. However, the types and amounts of VOCs emitted from Engelmann spruce and lodgepole pine are different, which suggests that additional measures of VOC emissions are needed to characterize the impact of bark beetle infestation on VOC emissions and SOA precursors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}Movement behaviour has become increasingly important in dispersal ecology and dispersal is central to the development of spatially explicit population ecology. The ways in which the elements have been brought together are reviewed with particular emphasis on dispersal distance distributions and the value of mechanistic models. There is a continuous range of movement behaviours and in some species, dispersal is a clearly delineated event but not in others. The biological complexities restrict conclusions to high-level generalizations but there may be principles that are common to dispersal and other movements. Random walk and diffusion models when appropriately elaborated can provide an understanding of dispersal distance relationships on spatial and temporal scales relevant to dispersal. Leptokurtosis in the relationships may be the result of a combination of factors including population heterogeneity, correlation, landscape features, time integration and density dependence. The inclusion in diffusion models of individual variation appears to be a useful elaboration. The limitations of the negative exponential and other phenomenological models are discussed. The dynamics of metapopulation models are sensitive to what appears to be small differences in the assumptions about dispersal. In order to represent dispersal realistically in population models, it is suggested that phenomenological models should be replaced by those based on movement behaviour incorporating individual variation. The conclusions are presented as a set of candidate principles for evaluation. The main features of the principles are that uncorrelated or correlated random walk, not linear movement, is expected where the directions of habitat patches are unpredictable and more complex behaviour when organisms have the ability to orientate or navigate. Individuals within populations vary in their movement behaviour and dispersal; part of this variation is a product of random elements in movement behaviour and some of it is heritable. Local and metapopulation dynamics are influenced by population heterogeneity in dispersal characteristics and heritable changes in dispersal propensity occur on time-scales short enough to impact population dynamics},

abstract = {What factors are responsible for the introduction of new policies (especially those involving substantive change) is a phenomenon that is still poorly understood. Researchers have identified policy windows where a confluence of events, such as a change in government, the emergence of a new issue, and ongoing policy processes, come together to create the opportunity for new policy development. Natural disasters can open such policy windows by drawing attention to an issue and mobilizing political will. Yet at the same time, even if policy windows do open, they may not result in effective policy development. The institutional setting in which such policies are developed also plays a key role. In the case of the Canadian forest sector, the combination of public resources and private capital make policy development especially challenging. Although the scale of the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic in British Columbia is unprecedented, and will change the nature of the forest resource (and by extension the industry and communities that rely upon it), the policy response has been limited to short-term measures. Although some policy reform was introduced, policy makers have yet to address the question of whether more fundamental changes are required in order to address the full consequences of the epidemic.},

abstract = {The current epidemic of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) in British Columbia, Canada, has impacted an area of over 13 million hectares presenting a considerable challenge to provincial forest resource managers. Remote sensing technologies offer a highly effective tool to monitor this impact due to very large areas involved and its ability to detect dead and dying tree crowns. Conventionally, change detection procedures based upon spectral values have been applied; however, analysis of landscape pattern changes associated with long-time series change detection approaches present opportunities for the generation of unique and ecologically important information. This study is focussed on the detection and monitoring of the shape and area characteristics of lodgepole pine stands during mountain pine beetle infestation to quantify the progression of forest fragmentation and related loss of landscape connectivity. A set of landscape pattern indices were applied to a set of images consisting of six Landsat satellite images spanning the period from 1993 to 2006. Our results indicate that the impacts of the mountain pine beetle infestation on forest spatial pattern consist of an increase in the number of patches, an increase in forest patch shape complexity, a reduction in forest patch size, an increase in forest patch isolation, and a decrease in interspersion. These findings demonstrate the unique information available from long-time series satellite imagery combined with pattern analysis to better understand the combined effects of insect infestation and forest salvage and harvesting. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Lidar is currently the most accurate method for remote estimation of forest structure, but it has limited spatial and temporal coverage. Conversely, Landsat data are more widely available, but exhibit a weaker relationship with structure under medium to high leaf area conditions. One potentially valuable means of enhancing the relationship between Landsat reflectance and forest structure is to incorporate Landsat spectral trends prior to a date of interest. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is linked to the stand's disturbance history, an approach that directly leverages the temporal information of Landsat time series should improve estimates of forest structure. The main objective of this study was to test and demonstrate the utility of disturbance and recovery metrics derived from spectral profiles of annual Landsat time series (LTS) to predict current forest structure attributes (as compared to more traditional approaches, including airborne, discrete return lidar and single-date Landsat). We estimated aboveground live biomass (AGB live), dead woody biomass (AGB dead), basal area (live and dead), and Lorey's mean stand height for a mixed-conifer forest in eastern Oregon, USA, and compared the results with estimates from lidar and single, current-date Landsat imagery. Annual time-series stacks for the entire Landsat record (1972-2010) were obtained to characterize all long-term (insect, growth) and short-term (fire, harvest) vegetation changes that occurred during that period. This required the additional objective of integrating Landsat data from MSS and TM/ETM+sensors, and we describe here our approach. To extract spectral trajectories and change metrics associated with forest disturbances and recovery we applied a temporal segmentation to the calibrated time series.Lidar predicted forest structure of live trees most accurately (e.g. AGB live: R 2=0.88, RMSE=35.3Mgha -1). However, LTS metrics significantly improved model predictions (e.g. AGB live: R 2=0.80, RMSE=46.9Mgha -1) compared to single-date Landsat data (AGB live, R 2=0.58, RMSE=65.1Mgha -1). Conversely, distributions of AGB dead were more strongly associated with disturbance history than current structure of live trees. As a result, LTS models performed significantly better in estimating AGB dead (R 2=0.73, RMSE=31.0Mgha -1), than lidar models (R 2=0.21, RMSE=43.8Mgha -1); and single-date Landsat data failed completely (R 2=0, RMSE=47.8Mgha -1). Further, LTS metrics that integrated disturbance and recovery history over the entire time series generally predicted AGB dead better than metrics describing single events only (e.g. the greatest disturbance). This study demonstrates the unique value of the long, historic Landsat record, and suggests new potentials for mapping current forest structure with Landsat. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Discriminant function analysis - useful in determining whether a set of variables is effective in predicting category membership.[2]
Discriminant analysis works by creating one or more linear combinations of predictors, creating a new latent variable for each function. These functions are called discriminant functions. The number of functions possible is either Ng-1 where Ng = number of groups, or p (the number of predictors), whichever is smaller. The first function created maximizes the differences between groups on that function. The second function maximizes differences on that function, but also must not be correlated with the previous function. This continues with subsequent functions with the requirement that the new function not be correlated with any of the previous functions.Given group ￼, with ￼ sets of sample space, there is a discriminant rule such that if ￼, then ￼. Discriminant analysis then, finds “good” regions of ￼ to minimize classification error, therefore leading to a high percent correct classified in the classification table.Hardle, W., Simar, L.

Although various remote sensing approaches have been developed to monitor insect impacts, most studies have focused on single insect agents or single locations and have not related observed changes to ground-based measurements. This study presents a remote sensing framework to (1) characterize spectral trajectories associated with insect activity of varying duration and severity and (2) relate those trajectories to ground-based measurements of tree mortality and surface fuels in the Cascade Range, Oregon, USA. We leverage a Landsat time series change detection algorithm (LandTrendr), annual forest health aerial detection surveys (ADS), and field measurements to investigate two study landscapes broadly applicable to conifer forests and dominant insect agents of western North America. We distributed 38 plots across multiple forest types (ranging from mesic mixed-conifer to xeric lodgepole pine) and insect agents (defoliator [western spruce budworm] and bark beetle [mountain pine beetle]). Insect effects were evident in the Landsat time series as combinations of both short- and long-duration changes in the Normalized Burn Ratio spectral index. Western spruce budworm trajectories appeared to show a consistent temporal evolution of long-duration spectral decline (loss of vegetation) followed by recovery, whereas mountain pine beetle plots exhibited both short- and long-duration spectral declines and variable recovery rates. Although temporally variable, insect-affected stands generally conformed to four spectral trajectories: short-duration decline then recovery, short- then long-duration decline, long-duration decline, long-duration decline then recovery. When comparing remote sensing data with field measurements of insect impacts, we found that spectral changes were related to cover-based estimates (tree basal area mortality [R2adj=0.40, F1,34=24.76, P{\textless}0.0001] and down coarse woody detritus [R2adj=0.29, F1,32=14.72, P=0.0006]). In contrast, ADS changes were related to count-based estimates (e.g., ADS mortality from mountain pine beetle positively correlated with ground-based counts [R2adj=0.37, F1,22=14.71, P=0.0009]). Fine woody detritus and forest floor depth were not well correlated with Landsat- or aerial survey-based change metrics. By characterizing several distinct temporal manifestations of insect activity in conifer forests, this study demonstrates the utility of insect mapping methods that capture a wide range of spectral trajectories. This study also confirms the key role that satellite imagery can play in understanding the interactions among insects, fuels, and wildfire. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Forest disturbances influence many landscape processes, including changes in microclimate, hydrology, and soil erosion. We analyzed the spectral response and temporal progress of two types of disturbances of spruce forest (bark beetle outbreak and clear-cuts) in the central part of {\v{S}}umava Mountains at the border between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The bark beetle (Ips typographus [L.]) outbreak in this region in the last 20 years resulted in regional-scale spruce forest decay. Clear-cutting was done here to prevent further bark-beetle propagation in the buffer zones. The aim of the study is to identify the differences in spectral response between the two types of forest disturbances and their temporal dynamics. General trends were analyzed throughout the study area, with sampled disturbance areas selected to assess the relationship between field vegetation data and their spectral response. Thirteen Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes from 1985 to 2007 were used for the assessment. The following spectral indices were estimated: NDMI, Tasseled Cap (Brightness, Greenness, Wetness), DI, and DI′. The DI′, Wetness, and Brightness indices show the highest sensitivity to forest disturbance for both disturbance types (clear-cuts and bark beetle outbreak). The multitemporal analysis distinguished three different stages of development. The highest spectral differences between the clear-cuts and the bark beetle disturbances were found in the period between 1996 and 2004 with increased levels of forest disturbance (repeated measures ANOVA, Scheff{\'{e}} post hoc test; p ≤ 0.05). Clear-cut disturbance resulted in significantly higher spectral differences from the original forest and occurred as a more discrete event in comparison to bark beetle outbreak. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The objective of this study is to provide an approach for assessing the short-term risk of mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) attack over large forested areas based on the spatial-temporal behavior of beetle spread. This is accomplished by integrating GIS, aerial overview surveys, and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) in order to measure the spatial relationships of mountain pine beetle impacts from one year to the next. Specifically, we implement a LISA method called the bivariate local Moran's Ii to estimate the risk of mountain pine beetle attack across the pine distribution of British Columbia, Canada. The bivariate local Moran's Ii provides a means for classifying locations into separate qualitative risk categories that describe insect population dynamics from one year to the next, revealing where mountain pine beetle populations are most likely to increase, stay constant, or decline. The accuracy of the model's prediction of qualitative risk was higher in initial years and lower in later years of the study, ranging from 91{\%} in 2002 to 72{\%} in 2006. The risk rating can be continually updated by utilizing annual overview surveys, thus ensuring that risk prediction remains relatively high in the short-term. Such information can equip forest managers with the ability to allocate mitigation resources for responding to insect epidemics over very large areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Vegetation indices and transformations have been used extensively in forest change detection studies. In this study, we processed multitemporal normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and tasseled cap wetness (TCW) data sets and compared their statistical relationships and relative efficiencies in detecting forest disturbances associated with forest type and harvest intensity at five, two and one year Landsat acquisition intervals. The NDMI and TCW were highly correlated ({\textgreater}0.95 r2) for all five image dates. There was no significant difference between TCW and NDMI for detecting forest disturbance. Using either a NDMI or TCW image differencing method, when Landsat image acquisitions were 5 years apart, clear cuts could be detected with nearly equal accuracy compared to images collected 2 years apart. Partial cuts had much higher commission and omission errors compared to clear cut. Both methods had 7-8{\%} higher commission and 12-22{\%} higher omission error to detect hardwood disturbance when it occurred in the first year of the 2-year interval (as compared to 1-year interval). Softwood and hardwood change detection errors were slightly higher at 2-year Landsat acquisition intervals compared to 1-year interval. For images acquired 1 and 2 years apart, NDMI forest disturbance commission and omission errors were slightly lower than TCW. The NDMI can be calculated using any sensor that has near-infrared and shortwave bands and is at least as accurate as TCW for detecting forest type and intensity disturbance in biomes similar to the Maine forest, particularly when Landsat images are acquired less than 2 years apart. Where partial cutting is the most dominant harvesting system as is currently the case in northern Maine, we recommend images collected every year to minimize (particularly omission) errors. However, where clear cuts or nearly complete canopy removal occurs, Landsat intervals of up to 5 years may be nearly as accurate in detecting forest change as 1 or 2 year intervals. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Over the past two decades, severe mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks have affected several million hectares of forest in western North America. The extensive ecological and economic damage caused by widespread insect infestations make understanding the development and spread of MPB outbreaks critical. This study uses a time series of Landsat5 TM and Landsat7 ETM. +. images to map the spread of mortality due to MPB infestation in Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado, between 2003 and 2010. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and change in the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) were used to classify red attack and non-red attack stands based on a maximum likelihood algorithm with manually selected training classes. The classification was validated by comparison with independent interpretations of aerial photography and high-resolution satellite imagery. The classification had good agreement (84.5-90.5{\%} total accuracy). Cluster analysis for time series showed infestations originating in several different locations on the landscape early in the time series and subsequent infestations likely represent a combination of dispersal from outbreak populations and independent population growth. Analysis using conditional inference trees suggested that a combination of forest composition, topography, and dispersal predicted the distribution of MPB infestation on the landscape and that the importance of these variables changed as the outbreak developed. In early years, red attack was associated with forest and topographic characteristics known to influence susceptibility to MPB. Over time, beetle pressure became an increasingly important predictor of red attack, but in later years host tree availability played an important role in outbreak spread. If this pattern occurs consistently in MPB outbreaks, knowledge of these patterns could aid managers in targeting their efforts to reduce damage resulting from MPB outbreaks. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {The current outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in western Canada has been increasing over the past decade and is currently estimated to be impacting 9.2 million hectares, with varying levels of severity. Large area insect monitoring is typically undertaken using manual aerial overview sketch mapping, whereby an interpreter depicts areas of homogenous insect attack conditions onto 1:250,000 or 1:100,000 scale maps. These surveys provide valuable strategic data for management at the provincial scale. The coarse spatial and attribute resolution of these data however, make them inappropriate for fine-scale monitoring and operational planning. For instance, it is not possible to estimate the initial timing of attack and year of stand death. In this study,we utilise eight Landsat scenes collected over a 14 year period in north- central British Columbia, Canada, where the infestation has gradually developed both spatially and temporally. After pre-processing and normalising the eight scenes using a relative normalisation procedure, decision tree analysis was applied to classify spectral trajectories of the Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). From the classified temporal sequence of images, key parameters were extracted including the presence of beetle disturbance and timing of stand decline. The accuracy of discriminating beetle attack from healthy forest stands was assessed both spatially and temporally using three years of aerial survey data (1996, 2003, and 2004) with results indicating overall classification accuracies varying between 71 and 86{\%}. As expected, the earliest and least severe attack year (1996), recorded the lowest overall accuracy. The relationship between the timing of stand attack (i.e. moderate to severe beetle infestation) and NDMI (initial year of detected disturbance) was also explored. The results suggest that there is potential for deriving regional estimates of the year of stand death using Landsat data and decision tree analysis however, a higher temporal frequency of images is required to quantify the timing of mountain pine beetle attack.},

abstract = {Tree-killing bark beetle species such as Ips sp. and Dendroctonus sp. are considered one of the most severe biotic hazards affecting forests at the global scale. Although spatio-temporal patterns of dispersal and infestations have been widely observed and statistically analyzed profound knowledge about the host-bark beetle interactions that evoke these patterns is scarce. We developed an individual-based and spatially explicit model - the Infestation Pattern Simulation (IPS) model - to elucidate how individual traits affect system-level dispersal and infestation patterns. IPS simulates processes including dispersal, host selection, aggregation, and finally colonization, or rejection by host defence on a local scale. Host-bark beetle interactions are implemented highly dynamically, i.e. individual adaptive behavior takes into account space- and time-dependent variations in traits. Simulations consider one dispersal wave starting from a single source located in a virtual stand. Finally, the effects of both bark beetle- and host tree-specific parameters on emerging system patterns were quantified using a one-factor-at-a-time sensitivity analysis approach. As system-level response variables we used (i) percentage of successful beetles, (ii) number of infestations, and (iii) maximum infestation distance to source. Among bark beetle-specific parameters those affecting host recognition (e.g. perceptual range, energetic level) and attack synchrony (e.g. source size, time lag between flight cohorts) were revealed to be highly sensitive with regard to all three response variables. In addition, the host tree's resistance and spatial distribution is also shown to be decisive for infestation occurrence. The model provides a conceptual framework linking individual behavior to system-level patterns. Thus it represents a powerful tool - complementing lab- and field-based approaches - which may contribute to our understanding of the complex spatio-temporal processes that govern host-bark beetle dynamics. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The eight-toothed spruce bark beetle ( Ips typographus ) is the most serious insect pest in Central European forests. During the past two decades, extreme meteorological events and subsequent beetle infestations have killed millions of cubic meters of standing spruce trees. Not all the infested stands could be cleared in time, and priorities in management had to be set. Natural or man-made buffer zones of about 500 meters in width are frequently defined to separate differently managed stands in Central Europe. While the buffer zones seem to be effective in most of the cases, their impact has not been studied in detail. Beetle densities were therefore assessed in three case studies using pheromone traps along transects, leading from infested stands into spruce-free buffer zones. The results of the trap catches allow an estimation of the buffer zone influence on densities and the dispersal of Ips typographus . Beetle densities were found to decrease rapidly with increasing distance from the infested spruce stands. The trap catches were below high-risk thresholds within a few hundred meters of the infested stands. The decrease in catches was more pronounced in open land and in an urban area than in a broadleaf stand. Designed buffer zones of 500 m width without spruce can therefore very probably help to reduce densities of spreading beetles.},

abstract = {Landsat satellite data has become ubiquitous in regional-scale forest disturbance detection. The Tasseled Cap (TC) transformation for Landsat data has been used in several disturbance-mapping projects because of its ability to highlight relevant vegetation changes. We used an automated composite analysis procedure to test four multi-date variants of the TC transformation (called "data structures" here) in their ability to facilitate identification of stand-replacing disturbance. Data structures tested included one with all three TC indices (brightness, greenness, wetness), one with just brightness and greenness, one with just wetness, and one called the Disturbance Index (DI) which is a novel combination of the three TC indices. Data structures were tested in the St. Petersburg region of Russia and in two ecologically distinct regions of Washington State in the US. In almost all cases, the TC variants produced more accurate change classifications than multi-date stacks of the original Landsat reflectance data. In general, there was little overall difference between the TC-derived data structures. However, DI performed better than the others at the Russian study area, where slower succession rates likely produce the most durable disturbance signal. Also, at the highly productive western Washington site, where the disturbance signal is likely the most ephemeral, DI and wetness performed worse than the larger data structures when a longer monitoring interval was used (eight years between image acquisitions instead of four). This suggests that both local forest recovery rates and the re-sampling interval should be considered in choosing a Landsat transformation for use in stand-replacing disturbance detection. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Provided appropriate imagery is selected to coincide with the manifestation of the red attack damage, the damage can be mapped in an accurate and timely fashion using Landsat Thematic Mapper or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery and change detection methods. This report describes a detailed procedure for using multiple dates of Landsat imagery to generate information products indicat¬ing the location and extent of mountain pine beetle red attack damage. The accuracy of this procedure is assessed and reported using more detailed forest health survey information at three sites in British Columbia. Also documented in this report is an optimal approach for Landsat scene selection, a summary of the level of effort required to apply the procedure described herein, and recommendations for potential improvements to the mapping procedure. Details on data acquisition, image pre-processing, image analysis, and accuracy assessment are included to facilitate the implementation for the mapping procedure in an operational context.},

abstract = {In the 1990s, a bark beetle (Ips typographus [ L.]) infection caused the decay of spruce forest ( Picea abies [ L.] Karst.) in the central part of the Sumava Mountains, the Czech Republic, bordering the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, where the bark beetle infection started in the late 1980s. Some areas were left without human intervention and, consequently, the trees around these areas were removed to stop further bark beetle outbreak. The objective of our study was the assessment of surface temperature (ST) change in spruce forest decayed under bark beetle and following clear-cutting. The change detection of ST is based on the comparison of modelled values and thermal satellite data. For this purpose, Landsat scenes from July 11th, 1987 and July 28th, 2002 were used. The models describe the dependence of ST of living spruce forest on topography. The topography effect is based on the Altitude and Hillshade index, which expresses the influence of Aspect and Slope on the relief illumination. Then the modelled ST values were extrapolated for decayed spruce forest and clear-cut areas. In order to increase model accuracy, the forest edge zones (90 m wide) were removed because of their different energy balance; then explained variability value (R-2) increased from 0.37 to 0.55. The results of comparing modelled values with satellite ST in the decayed spruce forest and clear-cut areas show an average increase of ST by 5.2 and 3.5 degrees C, respectively. The thermal satellite data from 1987 were used for model validation. This showed that the accuracy of ST modelling using topography was sufficient, because the difference between the modelled ST with and without decayed spruce forest and clear-cut areas was at most only 0.4 degrees C},

abstract = {Bark beetle population dynamics is thought to be primarily driven by bottom-up forces affecting insect performance and host tree resistance. Although there are theoretical predictions and empirical evidences that predation and parasitism may play an important role in driving bark beetle population fluctuations, long-term studies testing the role of both biotic and abiotic controls on population dynamics are still rare. The aim of the study was to quantify the relative importance of predation, negative density feedback and abiotic factors in driving Ips typographus population dynamics. We analyzed a unique time series of population density of I. typographus and its main predator Thanasimus formicarius over almost two decades in four regions across Sweden. We used a discrete population model and a multi-model inference approach to evaluate the importance of both bottom up and top down factors. We found that availability of breeding substrates in the form of storm-felled trees was the main outbreak trigger, while strong intra-specific competition for host trees was the main endogenous regulating factor. Although temperature-related metrics are known to have strong individual effect on I. typographus development and number of generations, they did not emerge as important drivers of population dynamics. A positive effect of low summer rainfall was evident only in the region located in the southernmost and warmest part of the spruce distribution range in Sweden. Predator density did not emerge as an important prey regulating factor. As the reported damage from storms seems to have increased across whole Europe, spruce forests are expected to be increasingly susceptible to large outbreaks of I. typographus with important economic and ecological consequences for boreal ecosystems. However, the observed negative density feedback seems to be a natural regulating mechanism that impedes a strong long-term propagation of the outbreaks.},

abstract = {We introduce and test LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract spectral trajectories of land surface change fromyearly Landsat time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-termtrends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slowrates on landscapes. This concept requires both newalgorithms to extract change and newinterpretation tools to validate those algorithms. The challenge is to resolve salient features of the time serieswhile eliminatingnoise introduced by ephemeral changes in illumination, phenology, atmospheric condition, and geometric registration. In the LandTrendr approach,we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create on- the-flymosaics ofmultiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis.Wethen apply temporal segmentation strategieswith both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters andthreshold-basedfiltering toreduce the role of falsepositivedetections.No suitable referencedata are available to assess the role of these controlparameters or totest overall algorithmperformance.Therefore,we also developed a companion interpretation approach founded on the same conceptual framework of capturing both long and short-duration processes, and developed a software tool to apply this concept to expert interpretation and segmentation of spectral trajectories (TimeSync, described in a companion paper by Cohen et al., 2010). These data were used as a truth set against which to evaluate the behavior of the LandTrendr algorithms applied to three spectral indices. We applied the LandTrendr algorithms to several hundred points across western Oregon andWashington (U.S.A.). Because of the diversity of potential outputs fromthe LTS data, we evaluated algorithm performance against summarymetrics for disturbance, recovery, and stability, both for capture of events and longer-duration processes. Despite the apparent complexity of parameters, our results suggest a simple grouping of parameters along a single axis that balances the detection of abrupt events with capture of long-duration trends.Overall algorithmperformancewas good, capturing a wide range of disturbance and recovery phenomena, even when evaluated against a truth set that contained new targets (recovery and stability) with much subtler thresholds of change than available from prior validation datasets. Temporal segmentation of the archive appears to be a feasible and robustmeans of increasing information extraction from the Landsat archive. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {Bark beetles colonize virtually all plant tissue types but are typically the most important pests of timber, tree fruit and seed crops, and ecologically important disturbance agents of forested landscapes around the world. For these reasons, scientists have been engaged for decades in elucidating the forces that affect their population dynamics. In this chapter, we review the population ecology of species exploiting seeds, herbaceous plants, and woody plants. We then examine the role that host tree resistance has played on life history trait evolution of conifer-feeding bark beetles and the patterns we observe in their population dynamics. The most important strategies for overcoming host plant resistance are: (1) adult aggregation capacity, (2) capacity to overwhelm tree defense, and (3) ability to tolerate host defenses. Variation in the presence of these traits among species influences their ability to access dead, weakened, or living trees (aggression) with corresponding effects on equilibrium population abundance and the influence of stochastic processes in their population dynamics. Stochastic processes that reinforce the traits listed above may generate positive feedback in aggressive species, permitting mass attack of healthy trees and the existence of an upper equilibrium, or outbreak density. Although stochastic factors influence variance in population abundance of less aggressive taxa, demographic constraints due to host resistance strongly regulate their populations near a low abundance equilibrium.},

abstract = {Aim Bark beetle outbreaks have recently affected extensive areas of western North American forests, and factors explaining landscape patterns of tree mortality are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of stand structure, topography, soil characteristics, landscape context (the characteristics of the landscape surrounding the focal stand) and beetle pressure (the abundance of local beetle population eruptions around the focal stand a few years before the outbreak) to explain landscape patterns of tree mortality during outbreaks of three species: the mountain pine beetle, which attacks lodgepole pine and whitebark pine; the spruce beetle, which feeds on Engelmann spruce; and the Douglas-fir beetle, which attacks Douglas-fir. A second objective was to identify common variables that explain tree mortality among beetletree host pairings during outbreaks. Location Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, Wyoming, USA. Methods We used field surveys to quantify stand structure, soil characteristics and topography at the plot level in susceptible stands of each forest type showing different severities of infestation (0-98{\%} mortality; n = 129 plots). We then used forest cover and beetle infestation maps derived from remote sensing to develop landscape context and beetle pressure metrics at different spatial scales. Plot-level and landscape-level variables were used to explain outbreak severity. Results Engelmann spruce and Douglas-fir mortality were best predicted using landscape-level variables alone. Lodgepole pine mortality was best predicted by both landscape-level and plot-level variables. Whitebark pine mortality was best although poorly - predicted by plot-level variables. Models including landscape context and beetle pressure were much better at predicting outbreak severity than models that only included plot-level measures, except for whitebark pine. Main conclusions Landscape-level variables, particularly beetle pressure, were the most consistent predictors of subsequent outbreak severity within susceptible stands of all four host species. These results may help forest managers identify vulnerable locations during ongoing outbreaks.},

abstract = {Timing of arrival at a resource often determines an individual's reproductive success. Tree-killing bark beetles can reproduce in healthy trees by attacking in adequate numbers to overcome host defences that could otherwise be lethal. This process is mediated by aggregation and antiaggregation pheromones. Beetles that arrive early in such a "mass attack" must contend with undiminished tree defences, and produce enough pheromones to attract more beetles, but have a head start on gallery construction and egg-laying. Beetles that arrive late may be impeded by competition and diminishing availability of phloem, but should experience fewer costs associated with pheromone production and battling tree defences. We investigated relationships between timing of arrival, body size, pheromone production and fitness in the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis. In field experiments, we captured beetles that arrived early (pioneers) and late on slash pine trees, Pinus elliottii, and measured pheromone amounts in their hindguts. We marked gallery entrances of beetles as they landed on a tree and measured their reproductive success after the attack terminated. We found no difference in body size or pheromone amounts between early and late arrivers. Most beetles arrived at the middle of the attack sequence, and excavated longer galleries per day than early arrivers. The number of offspring produced per day by beetles that established galleries midway through mass attack was higher than those that arrived early or very late in the sequence. Our results suggest that beetles do not exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in pre-landing pheromone production, depending on the extent of previous colonisation of a host. Rather, it appears that stabilising selection favours beetles that attack in the middle of the sequence, and contributes to attack synchrony. Synchronous attack on trees is essential before population booms characteristic of tree-killing bark beetles can occur in nature.},

abstract = {Characterizing how variation in forest landscape structure shapes patterns of natural disturbances and mediates interactions between multiple disturbances is critical for anticipating ecological consequences of climate change in high-latitude forest ecosystems. During the 1990s, a massive spruce bark beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreak took place in boreal spruce forest on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska allowing us to ask (1) How did the extent and duration of bark beetle outbreak differ between a homogenous landscape dominated by white spruce (Picea glauca), and a landscape in which white spruce and black spruce (Picea mariana) were intermixed? (2) How has the occurrence and duration of bark beetle outbreak influenced the likelihood of subsequent burning in these two landscapes? Forest landscape structure had a substantial effect on disturbance patterns and interactions between disturbances in this study. The spruce bark beetle outbreak was smaller in extent and duration where white spruce, the beetle's primary host tree, was intermixed with more beetle-resistant black spruce. However, likelihood of subsequent burning increased where outbreak did occur. Surface fuel loads increased substantially in this landscape following the outbreak, potentially increasing the flammability of white spruce where they once served as fire breaks. In contrast, the outbreak was larger and lasted longer in the landscape with homogeneous stands of white spruce, but was not related to likelihood of subsequent burning, which is consistent with the fire history. Our results suggest that bark beetle outbreaks may have different effects on subsequent patterns of burning than in other systems, such as the Rocky Mountains. These results could inform more effective and targeted management strategies to ameliorate fire risk in beetle-killed stands of Alaska and may help us anticipate the dynamics and consequences of future boreal bark beetle outbreaks as climate warms at high latitudes.},

abstract = {At present, monitoring of mountain glaciers and permafrost creep is being confronted with new challenges. High-mountain natural systems that involve surface and sub-surface ice change with rates which are with no historical precedences. Monitoring and decision strategies have to respond to this rapid evolution. New earth observation technologies in combination with geoinformatics have to be adapted or to be developed for glacier and rockglacier monitoring. Permafrost monitoring has to become an integrated part of the global terrestrial observation networks, like glacier monitoring is since many decades. In this work, an overview is provided of, for the most part, optical air- and spaceborne remote sensing methods, which are suitable for the investigation of mountain glaciers and permafrost creep. The topics covered range from the generation of digital terrain models, to the detection and quantiÞcation of terrain changes, to multispectral analyses. It is shown, how geoinformatics and visualization can be used to exploit these data. In a second main part of this volume, case studies are employed in order to exemplify and discus the methods presented. On the basis of repeat satellite imagery, the {\ss}ow of a number of glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya is examined for the Þrst time. A similar study revealed the surface velocity Þeld of the fast-{\ss}owing Kronebreen in Svalbard, and Tasman Glacier, New Zealand. Furthermore, the surge-type movement of Belvedere Glacier, a glacier instability which is exceptional in the European Alps, is analyzed using repeated aerial photography. A further chapter of case studies discusses and models spatio-temporal highresolution data on rockglacier deformation in the Swiss Alps. For the Þrst time, rockglacier advance and the evolution of micro-topography on creeping permafrost is investigated in great detail. The sensitivity of rockglacier creep to temperature changes is discussed. Techniques similar to those developed here for rockglaciers are applied to paraglacial rock mass movements also. In this way, it is possible to gain insight into the dynamics and internal structure of such slope instabilities. Application schemes that combine and exemplify the techniques presented in this volume are compiled for the assessment of glacier- and permafrost-related hazards, and for glacier inventorying based on multispectral imagery. Research perspectives rising from the methodology shown and from the test studies conducted conclude the individual sections, and the end of this work. Among these perspectives, the global availability of medium- to high-resolution digital terrain models plays a prominent role. The increasing temporal and spatial resolution of earth observation sensors bears a great potential for multidimensional examination and time series analyses of mountain glaciers and rockglaciers.},

abstract = {Long-distance dispersal (LDD) includes events in which propagules arrive, but do not necessarily establish, at a site far removed from their origin. Although important in a variety of ecological contexts, the system-specific nature of LDD makes ‘‘far removed'' difficult to quantify, partly, but not exclusively, because of inherent uncertainty typically involved with the highly stochastic LDD processes. We critically review the main methods employed in studies of dispersal, in order to facilitate the evaluation of their pertinence to specific aspects of LDD research. Using a novel classification framework, we identify six main methodological groups: biogeographical; Eulerian and Lagrangian movement/redistributional; short-term and long-term genetic analyses; and modeling. We briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the most promising methods available for estimation of LDD, illustrating them with examples from current studies. The rarity of LDD events will continue to make collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the necessary data difficult, and a simple and comprehensive definition of LDD will remain elusive. However, considerable advances have been made in some methodological areas, such as miniaturization of tracking devices, elaboration of stable isotope and genetic analyses, and refinement of mechanistic models. Combinations of methods are increasingly used to provide improved insight on LDD from multiple angles. However, human activities substantially increase the variety of long-distance transport avenues, making the estimation of LDD even more challenging.},

However, dispersal has not featured prominently as the defining and critical element of IPM schemes. At the larger regional or inter-continental scales then our understanding of dispersal has improved with the availability of new tracking technologies (e.g., Doppler weather radar, see Westbrook and Isard (1999)), but proportionate returns in terms of IPM have not been demonstrated. There is increasing interest in describing within-field and within-plant dispersal events, but much remains to be done to integrate research findings into operational IPM programmes. Models are often seen as useful tools for analysing pest and disease outbreaks and for the evaluation of alternative control options. Dispersal, in full biophysical detail, has rarely featured explicitly in such models, and indeed the lack of biological balance in complex simulation models places their uses in research, technology development or implementation somewhat in doubt. Often, however, it is possible to incorporate dispersal or more generally spatial processes into simplified models that combine applicability to real pest management situations with the insights of theoretical population ecology. Such insights are relevant to the multiple-species interactions characteristic of biological control and the ways in which dispersal affects the qualitative attributes of these interactions. Dispersal research has had a demonstrable impact on pest management and new opportunities will arise in the future. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Insect outbreaks exert landscape-level influences, yet quantifying the relative contributions of various exogenous and endogenous factors that contribute to their pattern and spread remains elusive. We examine an outbreak of mountain pine beetle covering an 800 thousand ha area on the Chilcotin Plateau of British Columbia, Canada, during the 1970s and early 1980s. We present a model that incorporates the spatial and temporal arrangements of outbreaking insect populations, as well as various climatic factors that influence insect development. Onsets of eruptions of mountain pine beetle demonstrated landscape-level synchrony. On average, the presence of outbreaking populations was highly correlated with outbreaking populations within the nearest 18 km the same year and local populations within 6 km in the previous two years. After incorporating these spatial and temporal dependencies, we found that increasing temperatures contributed to explaining outbreak probabilities during this 15 yr outbreak. During collapse years, landscape-level synchrony declined while local synchrony values remained high, suggesting that in some areas host depletion was contributing to population decline. Model forecasts of outbreak propensity one year in advance at a 12 by 12 km scale provided 80{\%} accuracy over the landscape, and never underestimated the occurrence of locally outbreaking populations. This model provides a flexible approach for linking temperature and insect population dynamics to spatial spread, and complements existing decision support tools for resource managers.},

abstract = {The current mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonous ponderosae Hopkins) epidemic has severely affected pine forests of Western Canada and killed millions of hectares of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) forest. Generally, MPB attack larger and older (diameter {\textgreater} 20 cm or {\textgreater}60 years of age) trees, but the current epidemic extends this limit with attacks on even younger and smaller trees. The study's aim was to investigate the extent of MPB attack in young pine stands and its possible impact on stand dynamics. Although MPB attacks were observed in trees as small as 7.5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) and as young as 13 years old, the degree of MPB attack (percent stems ha−1) increased with increasing tree diameter and age class (13–20, 21–40, 41–60, and 61–80 years old) (6.4{\%}, 49.4{\%}, 62.6{\%}, and 69.5{\%} attack, respectively, by age class) which is greater than that reported from previous epidemics for stands of this age. The mean density of surviving residual structure varied widely among age classes and ecological subzones. Depending on age class, 65{\%} to 77{\%} of the attacked stands could contribute to mid-term timber supply. The surviving residual structure of young stands offers an opportunity to mitigate the effects of MPB-attack on future timber supply, increase age class diversity, and enhance ecological resilience in younger stands.},

abstract = {A large spatio-temporal data set monitoring the annual progress of bark beetle infestation in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany) is statistically analysed by means of complex image analysis algorithms. The infestation data were obtained by color-infrared (CIR) aerial image interpretation and cover 10 subsequent years (2001–2010). Newly emerged infestation patches are hypothesized as spatially correlated to locations of previous year's infestation. Both areas, source patches and subsequently emerged patches, are considered as two disjoint random sets. Their spatio-temporal dependence is analysed by two methods: the classical approach based on the measurement of cross-covariance functions, and a second one based on nearest neighbor distances. The resulting characteristics can be interpreted as pre-disposition probabilities of bark beetle infestation depending on distance to sources. Bothmethods showa strong short-range preference,which decreases with increasing distances.},

abstract = {With the entry into operation of the Sentinel‐2 mission in June 2015, a new land monitoring constellation of twin satellites has been added to the Copernicus project from ESA and new insights have been derived through the combination of Sentinel‐2 data with other optical/multispectral data, and with other data from satellites belonging to the same Copernicus project. To this end, the objective of this paper has been to present new added‐value tools first through the integration of different satellite platforms: data from NASA Landsat‐8 and ESA Sentinel‐1 have been used and combined, and furthermore through the comparison of satellite data all from the same Copernicus project: data from Sentinel‐1 and Sentinel‐2 have been jointly processed and compared. Although data from optical/multispectral sensors, as those of Landsat‐8 and Sentinel‐2, and data from SAR on board of Sentinel‐1, are very different, their combination provides useful and interesting results. The integration and combination of these data can find useful application in many fields from oceans to waterways, from land surfaces to fossil deposits, from vegetation to forest areas. In this works authors have focused their interest in green areas and vegetation monitoring applications, by choosing as case of interest the Royal Palace of Caserta and its gardens. The idea has started from the increasing interest in monitoring the cultural heritage monuments and in particular the surrounding vegetation with the green areas and the parks inside. Satellite images can put into evidence boundaries modifications, the vegetation state, their possible degradation, and other phenomena such as changes in the territories due both to natural and to anthropogenic causes. Data combination from different sources as above specified gives a good number of indexes very useful to analyze the vegetation state and its health in a very deep way. Many of these indexes have been calculated and discussed for investigation.},

abstract = {Question: (1) Which remote sensing classification most successfully identify aspen using multitemporal Landsat 5 TM images and airborne lidar data? (2) How has aspen distribution changed in southwestern Idaho? (3) Are topographic variables and conifer encroachment correlated with aspen changes? Location: Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in southwestern Idaho, USA. Methods: Multi-temporal Landsat 5 TM and lidar data were used individually and fused together. The best classification model was compared with a 1965 aspen map and tree ring data. Conifer encroachment was examined via image-based change detection and field mapping. Lidar-derived topographic variables were correlated with aspen change patterns using quantile regression models. Results: The best Landsat 5 TM classification was a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based approach with 92{\%} overall accuracy. The lidar classification of tree presence/absence performed with 100{\%} overall accuracy. Fusing the lidar classification with various Landsat 5 TM classifications improved overall accuracies 3 to 6{\%}. Among the fusion models, the NDVI-lidar fusion performed best with 96{\%} overall accuracy. Change detection indicated 69{\%} decline in aspen cover, but 179{\%} increase in aspen cover in other areas of the watershed. Conifers have completely replaced 17{\%} of the aspen, while 93{\%} of the remaining aspen stands have young Douglas-fir and western juniper trees underneath the aspen canopy. Aspen significantly decreased (P-values {\textless} 0.05) with increasing elevation (up to 2150 m) and decreasing slope. Conclusions: Landsat 5 TM data used with a NDVI-based approach provide an accurate method to classify aspen distribution. Landsat 5 TM classifications can be further improved via fusion with lidar data. Aspen change patterns are spatially variable: while aspen is drastically declining in some parts of this watershed, aspen is increasing in other areas.},

abstract = {Gap distributions in forests reflect the spatial impact of man-made tree harvesting or naturally-induced patterns of tree death being caused by windthrow, inter-tree competition, disease or senescence. Gap sizes can vary from large ({\textgreater}100 m2) to small $\backslash$r$\backslash$n({\textless}10 m2), and they may have contrasting spatial patterns, such as being aggregated or regularly distributed. However, very small gaps cannot easily be recorded with conventional aerial or satellite images, which calls for new and cost-effective methodologies of forest monitoring. Here, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and very high-resolution images to record the gaps in 10 temperate managed and unmanaged forests in two regions of Germany. All gaps were extracted for 1-ha study plots and subsequently analyzed with spatially-explicit statistics, such as the conventional $\backslash$r$\backslash$npair correlation function (PCF), the polygon-based PCF and the mark correlation function. Gap-size frequency was dominated by small gaps of an area {\textless}5 m2, which were particularly frequent in unmanaged forests. We found that gap distances showed a variety of patterns. However, the polygon-based PCF was a better descriptor of patterns than the conventional PCF, because it showed randomness or aggregation for cases when the conventional PCF showed small-scale regularity; albeit, the latter was only a mathematical artifact. The mark correlation function revealed that gap areas were in half of the cases negatively correlated and in the other half independent. Negative size correlations may likely be the result of single-tree harvesting or of repeated gap formation, which both lead to nearby small gaps. Here, we emphasize the usefulness of UAV to record forest gaps of a very small size. These small gaps may originate from repeated gap-creating disturbances, and their spatial patterns should be monitored with spatially-explicit statistics at recurring intervals in order to further insights into forest dynamics.},

abstract = {With climate change, extreme storms are expected to occur more frequently. These storms can cause severe forest damage, provoking direct and indirect economic losses for forestry. To minimize economic losses, the windthrow areas need to be detected fast to prevent subsequent biotic damage, for example, related to beetle infestations. Remote sensing is an efficient tool with high potential to cost-efficiently map large storm affected regions. Storm Niklas hit South Germany in March 2015 and caused widespread forest cover loss. We present a two-step change detection approach applying commercial very high-resolution optical Earth Observation data to spot forest damage. First, an object-based bi-temporal change analysis is carried out to identify windthrow areas larger than 0.5 ha. For this purpose, a supervised Random Forest classifier is used, including a semi-automatic feature selection procedure; for image segmentation, the large-scale mean shift algorithm was chosen. Input features include spectral characteristics, texture, vegetation indices, layer combinations and spectral transformations. A hybrid-change detection approach at pixel-level subsequently identifies small groups of fallen trees, combining the most important features of the previous processing step with Spectral Angle Mapper and Multivariate Alteration Detection. The methodology was evaluated on two test sites in Bavaria with RapidEye data at 5 m pixel resolution. The results regarding windthrow areas larger than 0.5 ha were validated with reference data from field visits and acquired through orthophoto interpretation. For the two test sites, the novel object-based change detection approach identified over 90{\%} of the windthrow areas (0.5 ha). The red edge channel was the most important for windthrow identification. Accuracy levels of the change detection at tree level could not be calculated, as it was not possible to collect field data for single trees, nor was it possible to perform an orthophoto validation. Nevertheless, the plausibility and applicability of the pixel-based approach is demonstrated on a second test site.},

abstract = {1 Quantifying dispersal in predator–prey systems can improve our understanding of how these species interact in space and time, as well as their relative distributions across complex landscapes. 2 We measured the dispersal abilities of three forest insects associated with red pine decline: the eastern five spined pine engraver Ips grandicollis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), its main predator Thanasimus dubius (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and the basal stem and root colonizer Dendroctonus valens (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). We also examined the edge behaviours of these species and the predator Platysoma spp (Coleoptera: Histeridae) between red pine stands (habitat) and clearings (nonhabitat). 3 Thanasimus dubius dispersed 12 times farther than its prey I. grandicollis, with 50{\%} of predators dispersing farther than 1.54 km. This profound difference in dispersal behaviour between prey and predator may contribute to the clumped distribution of I. grandicollis. 4 Most T. dubius and D. valens were confined in the pine forest, thus showing strong edge behaviour. This differed from I. grandicollis and Platysoma spp., which were commonly found in open areas adjacent to red pine plantations. 5 The bark beetle I. grandicollis and one of its main predators, T. dubius, exhibited different patterns of movement within a fragmented landscape. Despite a greater dispersal ability of T. dubius within forests, the spatial distribution of this predator may be restricted by fragmentation of its habitat, and provide an opportunity for partial escape of its prey. 6 The present study contributes to our knowledge of top-down forces within red pine stands undergoing decline. Differences of dispersal patterns and edge behaviour could contribute to the initiation of new pockets of decline, as well as the connectedness among existing ones.},

abstract = {The synoptic evolution and some meteorological impacts of the European winter storm Kyrill that swept across Western, Central, and Eastern Europe between 17 and 19 January 2007 are investigated. The intensity and large storm damage associated with Kyrill is explained based on synoptic and mesoscale environmental storm features, as well as on comparisons to previous storms. Kyrill appeared on weather maps over the US state of Arkansas about four days before it hit Europe. It underwent an explosive intensification over the Western North Atlantic Ocean while crossing a very intense zonal polar jet stream. A superposition of several favourable meteorological conditions west of the British Isles caused a further deepening of the storm when it started to affect Western Europe. Evidence is provided that a favourable alignment of three polar jet streaks and a dry air intrusion over the occlusion and cold fronts were causal factors in maintaining Kyrill's low pressure very far into Eastern Europe. Kyrill, like many other strong European winter storms, was embedded in a pre-existing, anomalously wide, north-south mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) gradient field. In addition to the range of gusts that might be expected from the synoptic-scale pressure field, mesoscale features associated with convective overturning at the cold front are suggested as the likely causes for the extremely damaging peak gusts observed at many lowland stations during the passage of Kyrill's cold front. Compared to other storms, Kyrill was by far not the most intense system in terms of core pressure and circulation anomaly. However, the system moved into a pre-existing strong MSLP gradient located over Central Europe which extended into Eastern Europe. This fact is considered determinant for the anomalously large area affected by Kyrill. Additionally, considerations of windiness in climate change simulations using two state-of-the-art regional climate models driven by ECHAM5 indicate that not only Central, but also Eastern Central Europe may be affected by higher surface wind speeds at the end of the 21st century. These changes are partially associated with the increased pressure gradient over Europe which is identified in the ECHAM5 simulations. Thus, with respect to the area affected, as well as to the synoptic and mesoscale storm features, it is proposed that Kyrill may serve as an interesting study case to assess future storm impacts.},

abstract = {Because of their significant impact on forests, tree-killing bark beetles have been widely studied at epidemic population densities. However, bark-beetle outbreaks emerge from populations at low, endemic levels, where population maintenance and growth depend on scarce, ephemeral resources such as lightning-struck trees, weakened and suppressed standing trees or wind-felled trees, depending on the species. The longevity of these resources strongly influences population dynamics, but very little is known in this respect.We tested the hypothesis that the driving factor reducing the availability of fallen trees is the decrease of their nutritional quality. We analysed the qualitative changes of the phloem of spruces artificially uprooted at different times (2-17. month before the experiment started) and simultaneously exposed during the same flight season to attacks of the major forest pest in Eurasia, Ips typographus. We also measured the impact of resources' decay on the insects' fecundity and the quality of their offspring.Our results show a surprisingly slow decrease of phloem quality over time. The beetles could develop on the oldest (17. month-old) resources with no significant differences in terms of fecundity, progeny body mass and global energy acquisition.Although they retain their nutritional quality over long periods, transient resources are exposed to other factors that make them rapidly unsuitable for I. typographus. We suggest that interspecific competition is probably the most influential of them, and acts as a major driver in the beetles' race for new resources. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We tested whether mountain pine beetles Dendroctonus ponderosae, an insect herbivore that exhibits outbreak population dynamics, modifies its habitat selection behaviour in response to density-dependent environmental shifts. Using an individual-based habitat selection model, we formulated predictions of how beetle population density will influence breeding habitat selectivity. Our model predicted that beetles should be more selective at intermediate densities than at low or high densities. The mechanisms influencing optimal selectivity differed between low and high density populations. In low density populations, breeding site availability was the primary factor affecting selectivity, whereas intraspecific competition and the reliability of habitat quality cues were important in high density populations. We tested our model predictions in natural populations that encompassed a range of beetle population densities. Our empirical findings supported the two key predictions from our model. First, habitat quality was more variable in high density populations. Second, individuals in high density populations were less selective compared to beetles from intermediate density populations. Our results demonstrate that beetles alter their habitat selection behaviour in response to density-dependent shifts. We propose that the behavioural changes we identified may influence the rate at which beetle populations transition between density states.},

abstract = {Results were analyzed from six previous studies in which marked bark and ambrosia beetles, Ips typographus, I. paraconfusus, and Trypodendron lineatum (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), were released at the center of concentric rings of pheromone traps. Assuming nearly straight flight paths, a “filtering” equation model predicts recapture percentages on several trap rings of specified radii, trap numbers, and effective attraction radius (EAR) of a pheromone trap. Equations were used to calculate recapture percentages on concentric trap rings as a function of increasing EAR and gave polynomial relationships for each ring with terms equal to the number of inner rings plus one. Results were confirmed by computer simulations. Filtering equations were iterated with increasing EAR values to find one that gave a recapture percentage for the innermost trap ring that matched the field results. The estimated EAR for a synthetic pheromone bait of I. typographus was similar in five tests (range 1.39–1.78 m), but in two other tests was larger (3.27 and 15.9 m). The EAR for pheromone of 75 male I. paraconfusus in ponderosa pine logs ranged from 0.35 to 34.5 m (mean of 4.7 m) and was generally larger for previously pheromone-responding beetles than for freshly emerged ones. For T. lineatum, the EAR of lineatin-baited traps at 100-m radius was 2.43 m. Recaptures of I. typographus were reasonably predicted by the estimated EARs in the filtering model. To obtain perfect fits, another model assumed the EAR could vary with ring radius (dispersal distance) and found that the EAR for I. typographus decreased with dispersal distance in four experiments, but increased or was variable in two others. However, in I. paraconfusus and T. lineatum, the EAR increased with dispersal distance. Simulations that varied combinations of the EAR and random angles of maximum turning (AMT) of beetles stepwise showed that a nearly straight flight path for I. typographus explained observed catches on trap rings best, while a higher AMT of 36° was better to explain catches of T. lineatum. Simulations show that catch per trap ring in relation to radial distance can be influenced by the beetleʼs AMT (still unobserved in the field). A conceptual model of dispersal and host selection in “aggressive” bark beetles with regard to pioneer and joiner colonization strategies is presented.},

abstract = {Among both ecologists and the wider community there is a tacit assumption that predators regulate populations of their prey. But there is evidence from a wide taxonomic and geographic range of studies that predators that are adapted to co-evolved prey generally do not regulate their prey. This is because predators either cannot reproduce as fast as their prey and/or are inefficient hunters unable to catch enough prey to sustain maximum reproduction. The greater capacity of herbivores to breed successfully is, however, normally restricted by a lack of enough food of sufficient quality to support reproduction. But whenever this shortage is alleviated by a large pulse of food, herbivores increase their numbers to outbreak levels. Their predators are unable to contain this increase, but their numbers, too, surge in response to this increase in food. Eventually both their populations will crash once the food supply runs out, first for the herbivores and then for the predators. Then an "over-run" of predators will further depress the already declining prey population, appearing to be controlling its abundance. This latter phenomenon has led many ecologists to conclude that predators are regulating the numbers of their prey. However, it is the same process that is revealed during outbreaks that limits populations of both predator and prey in "normal" times, although this is usually not readily apparent. Nevertheless, as all the diverse cases discussed here attest, the abundance of predators and their co-evolved prey are both limited by their food: the predators are passengers, not drivers. ?? 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Here, I argue that we should abandon the division between ‘‘field ecologists'' and ‘‘modelers,'' and embrace modeling and empirical research as two powerful and often complementary approaches in the toolbox of 21st century ecologists, to be de- ployed alone or in combination depending on the task at hand. As empirical research has the longer tradition in ecology, and modeling is the more re- cent addition to the methodological arsenal, I pro- vide both practical and theoretical reasons for integrating modeling more deeply into ecosystem research. Empirical research has epistemological priority over modeling; however, that is, for models to realize their full potential, and for modelers to wield this power wisely, empirical research is of fundamental importance. Combining both methodological approaches or forming ‘‘super ties'' with colleagues using different methods are promising pathways to creatively exploit the methodological possibilities resulting from increas- ing computing power. To improve the proficiency of the growing group of model users and ensure future innovation in model development, we need to increase the modeling literacy among ecology students. However, an improved training in mod- eling must not curtail education in basic ecological principles and field methods, as these skills form the foundation for building and applying models in ecology.},

abstract = {Restoration of protected areas in boreal forests frequently includes creating substantial volumes of dead wood. While this benefits a wide range of dead wood dependent invertebrate species, some of these are regarded as forest pests. Therefore, the risk of elevated levels of tree mortality in surroundingcommercial forestsmust be considered. In a large-scale field experiment in southern Finland,westudied the effects of restoration treatments on the abundance of bark beetles within and in the vicinity of restored areas, in particular focusing on Ips typographus and Pityogenes chalcographus. The treatments applied tomanaged Norway spruce forests were controlled burning and partial harvesting combined with retaining 5, 30 or 60m3/ha of cut down wood.Wefound that the abundance of bark beetles increased by both burning and harvesting with down wood retention, being highest where burning and harvesting had been combined. The actual volume of down wood retention had no significant effect. The effect of burning on the number of bark beetles along host tree boles was negative which suggests that burnt spruces provided a less suitable resource for bark beetles than unburnt dead spruces. The abundance of bark beetles along host trees also decreased with increasing volume of down wood retention. The abundance of P. chalographus was slightly elevated up to 50moutside restored areas but the abundancewas very low compared to that within the areas. The abundance of I. typographus was extremely low outside restored areas.Weconclude that restoration treatments increase the abundance of bark beetles via increased availability of resources, but that the effect of burning is likely to be counteracted by decreased resource quality. Thus, burning might be the ‘‘safest'' way to produce large quantities of dead wood. Furthermore, the fact that only few beetleswere collected in adjacent areas suggests that restored areas pose little threat of serving as refugia in which bark beetle populations increase in sufficient numbers to attack live trees in adjacent forests. However, restoration actions repeated at consecutive years within a small area might enable the populations to grow to outbreak levels.},

abstract = {I draw attention to the need for ecologists to take spatial structure into account more seriously in hypothesis testing. If spatial autocorrelation is ignored, as it usually is, then analyses of ecological patterns in terms of environmental factors can produce very misleading results. This is demonstrated using synthetic but realistic spatial patterns with known spatial properties which are subjected to classical correlation and multiple regression analyses. Correlation between an autocorrelated response variable and each of a set of explanatory variables is strongly biased in favour of those explanatory variables that are highly autocorrelated – the expected magnitude of the correlation coefficient increases with autocorrelation even if the spatial patterns are completely independent. Similarly, multiple regression analysis finds highly autocorrelated explanatory variables ‘‘significant'' much more frequently than it should. The chances of mistakenly identifying a ‘‘significant'' slope across an autocorrelated pattern is very high if classical regression is used. Consequently, under these circumstances strongly autocorrelated environmental factors reported in the literature as associated with ecological patterns may not actually be significant. It is likely that these factors wrongly described as important constitute a red-shifted subset of the set of potential explanations, and that more spatially discontinuous factors (those with bluer spectra) are actually relatively more important than their present status suggests. There is much that ecologists can do to improve on this situation. I discuss various approaches to the problem of spatial autocorrelation from the literature and present a randomisation test for the association of two spatial patterns which has advantages over currently available methods.},

abstract = {There is often need to measure aggregation levels of spatial patterns within a single map class in landscape ecological studies. The contagion index (CI), shape index (SI), and probability of adjacency of the same class (Qi), all have certain limits when measuring aggregation of spatial patterns. We have developed an aggregation index (AI) that is class specific and independent of landscape composition. AI assumes that a class with the highest level of aggregation (AI =1) is comprised of pixels sharing the most possible edges. A class whose pixels share no edges (completely disaggregated) has the lowest level of aggregation (AI =0). AI is similar to SI and Qi, but it calculates aggregation more precisely than the latter two. We have evaluated the performance of AI under varied levels of (1) aggregation, (2) number of patches, (3) spatial resolutions, and (4) real species distribution maps at various spatial scales. AI was able to produce reasonable results under all these circumstances. Since it is class specific, it is more precise than CI, which measures overall landscape aggregation. Thus, AI provides a quantitative basis to correlate the spatial pattern of a class with a specific process. Since AI is a ratio variable, map units do not affect the calculation. It can be compared between classes from the same or different landscapes, or even the same classes from the same landscape under different resolutions.},

abstract = {To gain understanding of patterns in forest structure and their causes, we mapped the distribution of three canopy cover classes and measured change in one of them over 40 years using aerial photographs for the 500 ha Neskowin Crest Research Natural Area (Lincoln and Tillamook Counties, Oregon). One class (fine texture, trees of uniform crown diameter and height) covered about half the area; it was identified as second growth originating after a large regional fire in 1845. The other major class (coarse texture, trees of variable crown diameter and height), occupying about 35{\%} of the area, was unburned or partially burned in 1845. The third class (openings with down stems visible on the ground) was blowdown patches. The blowdown patches were very small in 1953; they grew incrementally, and by 1994 had coalesced into a large patch occupying about 15{\%} of the area. A long-term windstorm susceptibility model developed for southeast Alaska identified the region where the blowdown patch occurred as being very susceptible to maritime windstorm disturbance. This correspondence between predicted susceptibility to damage and actual blowdown supports the hypothesis that windstorm effects may be strongly constrained by topography. The results also suggest that blowdown in storm-susceptible topographic settings can be the result of multiple windstorm events over time, rather than a single event. The resulting forest is a mosaic of large multi-aged chronic-disturbance patches embedded in a matrix structured by fine-scale patch processes. A consequence of a constraint on blowdown is that at the scale of hundreds of hectares biomass may not fluctuate strongly over time unless stand-destroying fires occur. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recently there has been an increasing interest in variables such as the leaf area index (LAI) that can be used to describe forest ecosystem processes and that can be obtained through optical remote sensing. The generic nature of remote sensing techniques and the wide range of spatial and temporal resolutions of the data sets make it possible to apply remote sensing in studying various processes and structure of a multitude of terrestrial ecosystems. The prerequisite for the development of any remote sensing application should nevertheless be an understanding of the physical principles behind the spectral signal measured by satellite- or air-borne instruments. The boreal forests of the northern hemisphere, dominated by coniferous tree species, form the largest unbroken forest zone in the world. From the perspective of remote sensing, a widely acknowledged, but poorly explained phenomenon is the generally observed lower spectral reflectances of coniferous forests when compared to broadleaved forests. The only alternative to explaining this phenomenon is studying the radiative transfer process in coniferous canopies. In this dissertation, the relationships of spectral and structural properties of boreal coniferous forests were investigated through empirical and simulation studies, and this new information was applied in LAI retrieval from optical satellite images over conifer-dominated areas in Finland. The first part assessed the effect of macro- and microscale grouping on the spectral signature of coniferous stands. Results indicated that crown size and shape are important factors influencing stand reflectance and that a main explanation for the low reflectances of conifer stands especially in the near infrared wavelengths is the high level of within-shoot scattering. The second part focused on estimating LAI from optical satellite images both using spectral vegetation indices and by inverting a physically based forest reflectance model. Both methods indicated their feasibility for LAI estimation. A general observation was that inclusion of the previously little-used middle infra-red wavelength in both retrieval methods slightly improves the remotely sensed LAI estimates for conifers.},

abstract = {Bark beetles feed and reproduce in the phloem/cambium tissue of trees where severe competition between individuals of the same and different species significantly reduces their reproductive success. In this coevolutionary setting, individuals that can avoid competition whenever possible by means of genetically controlled behavioral mechanisms are naturally selected.  Avoidance of intraspecific and interspecific competition is accomplished in part even before landing by olfactory perception of specific pheromones and allomones.  These olfactory systems may function at least as well after landing.  In several species the uniform distribution of attacks on host trees indicates that individuals avoid competition by only attacking if they are at least a minimum distance from other established attacks. Once beetles are under the bark their tunneling patterns indicate that a behavioral mechanism exists to avoid intersecting nearby galleries of competing individuals.  Finally, beetles may choose to re-emerge if the expected chances of successful reproduction by continuing their stay becomes less than the probabilities of finding another host and successfully reproducing.},

abstract = {Forests contain a majority of the aboveground carbon (C) found in ecosystems, and understanding biomass lost from disturbance is essential to improve our C-cycle knowledge. Our study region in the Wisconsin and Minnesota Laurentian Forest had a strong decline in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1982 to 2007, observed with the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). To understand the potential role of disturbances in the terrestrial C-cycle, we developed an algorithm to map forest disturbances from either harvest or insect outbreak for Landsat time-series stacks. We merged two image analysis approaches into one algorithm to monitor forest change that included: (1) multiple disturbance index thresholds to capture clear-cut harvest; and (2) a spectral trajectory-based image analysis with multiple confidence interval thresholds to map insect outbreak. We produced 20 maps and evaluated classification accuracy with air-photos and insect air-survey data to understand the performance of our algorithm. We achieved overall accuracies ranging from 65{\%} to 75{\%}, with an average accuracy of 72{\%}. The producer's and user's accuracy ranged from a maximum of 32{\%} to 70{\%} for insect disturbance, 60{\%} to 76{\%} for insect mortality and 82{\%} to 88{\%} for harvested forest, which was the dominant disturbance agent. Forest disturbances accounted for 22{\%} of total forested area (7349 km2). Our algorithm provides a basic approach to map disturbance history where large impacts to forest stands have occurred and highlights the limited spectral sensitivity of Landsat time-series to outbreaks of defoliating insects. We found that only harvest and insect mortality events can be mapped with adequate accuracy with a non-annual Landsat time-series. This limited our land cover understanding of NDVI decline drivers. We demonstrate that to capture more subtle disturbances with spectral trajectories, future observations must be temporally dense to distinguish between type and frequency in heterogeneous landscapes.},

abstract = {Recent developments in UK forestry policy require the adoption of management practices that maintain and improve the biodiversity of managed forests. One approach is to use natural disturbance in unmanaged forests as a template for setting the scale, frequency and pattern of forest operations in managed forests. This review considers the relevance of this approach for conifer plantations in upland Britain. The dynamics of British planted forests are compared with the disturbance dynamics of analogous natural forests with particular reference to disturbance by strong winds. Western hemlock-Sitka spruce (Tsuga heterophylla-Picea sitchensis) forests in the Pacific North-west of North America and particularly South-east Alaska provide the most promising comparison. There are few reports on disturbance in these forests, but the regime includes both gap-phase and stand replacement dynamics due to wind. However, the landscape proportion and pattern of resulting structural types are not well defined. The dynamics of planted forests in Britain are dominated by rotational patch clearfelling which results in regular stand replacement and little possibility of the stands developing beyond the stage of stem exclusion towards old-growth. The pattern and timing of felling is driven by economic and visual amenity considerations rather than by an attempt to mimic natural disturbance patterns. Moreover, the structural complexity and remnant elements (such as deadwood, large trees, vegetation patches) left after large scale disturbance are rarely found after conventional timber harvesting. The authors conclude that natural wind disturbance regimes have potential as a reference point for management in British upland forests but at present are not relevant as a model to mimic explicitly This is because the biodiversity benefits of adopting a 'natural' approach in planted forests are unclear compared with management guided by other criteria such as rarity. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal pattern to be mimicked is not sufficiently well understood. Improved knowledge could inform decisions on the scale and distribution of harvesting across a landscape, and modify silvicultural operations to create and maintain the structures and patterns associated with natural disturbance. However, further research is needed to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of wind disturbance in upland forests in Britain and in natural forests elsewhere},

Thresholds in landscape structure were observed on a gradient of percentages of landscape cutover.

abstract = {Large-scale natural disturbances pose challenges for the management of protected areas and may have undesirable consequences for commercial plantations nearby. A storm, which felled nearly 10 000 m3 of spruce forest in the Osaby nature reserve in southern Sweden, allowed us to study the subsequent population development of the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). Two summers after the storm, an exceptionally high proportion (74{\%}) of wind-felled trees had been successfully colonized by the bark beetle, and all living spruce trees had been killed. On standing trees, colonization density was three times higher, and reproductive success one-fourth, that on wind-felled trees. The negative relationship between colonization density and reproductive success indicates that intra-specific competition is one of the main mechanisms reducing I. typographus population growth when the beetles switch from wind-felled to standing trees after storm disturbances. Indeed, there was no significant difference in beetle production between wind-felled and standing trees. Furthermore, there were no differences in colonization density, reproductive success or production at different heights in standing trees; however, a higher proportion of the new adults emerged at the tree-tops rather than lower down before overwintering. Our results also demonstrate that a large proportion (ca. 50{\%}) of the I. typographus population that developed in the storm-fell area apparently overwintered under the bark of standing trees.},

abstract = {The live plant nursery trade is a potential vector for pests and pathogens, which can spread to natural and developed environments with unintended ecosystem consequences. Simulated, approximately scale-free, tiered horticultural trade networks consisting of growers, wholesalers, and retailers were used to study the efficacy of quarantine inspection and isolation procedures for reducing the spread of infected materials to consumers. The quarantine algorithm temporarily isolated infected nurseries from the rest of the trade network, rewiring the affected trade connections to unquarantined nodes, until the infection was reduced below the detection threshold, at which time the formerly infected nursery was reincorporated into the trade network.Nodes were inspected for infection at regular intervals. Increasing the inspection interval resulted in higher levels of infection with large, system-wide oscillations whose period that matched the inspection interval. The timing of quarantine inspections of the largest hub in the grower tier drove the dynamics of the entire network. Increasing the proportion of growers or wholesalers increased infection level in most networks. Increasing the connectivity within the grower and wholesaler tiers led to large increases in mean infection levels. Focusing quarantine inspection efforts on hubs in the grower and wholesaler tiers may be the most efficient method for reducing the level of infected plant material sold by retailers in real plant trade networks.},

The two highest ( – )- -pinene : pheromone ratios (526 : 1 and 2595 : 1) attracted twice as many I. typographus as pheromone alone, whereas low to intermediate ratios (56 : 1, 274 : 1) did not differ from pheromone alone. 4 Our results are in agreement with a proposed model, which suggests that bark beetles display unique response profiles to host terpenes depending on the physiological condition of the host trees that they typically colonize. Ips typographus , which is an aggressive species capable of colonizing and killing healthy trees, showed an increased attraction to monoterpene : pheromone ratios, and this may be high enough to inhibit attraction of less aggressive beetle species typically colonizing dead, dying or stressed trees. 5 Attraction of associates of I. typographus was also modified by ( – )- -pinene. Ips duplicatus , a competitor of I. typographus , showed increased attraction to the pheromone of I. typographus across all concentrations of ( – )- -pinene.},

abstract = {Bark beetle species within the scolytid genera Dendroctonus, Ips, Pityogenes and Tomicus are known to cause extensive ecological and economical damage in spruce and pine forests during epidemic outbreaks all around the world. Dendroctonus ponderosae poses the most recent example having destroyed almost 100,000 km² of conifer forests in North America. The success and effectiveness of scolytid species lies mostly in strategies developed over the course of time. Among these, a complex system of semiochemicals promotes the communication and aggregation on the spot of infestation facilitating an en masse attack against a host tree's defenses; or an association with fungi that evolved either in the form of nutrition (ambrosia fungi) or even by reducing the resistance of host trees (blue-stain fungi). Although often specific to a tree genus or species, some bark beetles are polyphagous and have the ability to switch on to new hosts and extend their host range (i.e., between conifer genera such as Pityogenes chalcographus or even from conifer to deciduous trees as Polygraphus grandiclava). A combination of these capabilities in concert with life history or ecological traits explains why bark beetles are considered interesting subjects in evolutionary studies. Several bark beetle species appear in phylogeographic investigations, in an effort to improve our understanding of their ecology, epidemiology and evolution. In this paper investigations that unveil the phylogeographic history of bark beetles are reviewed. A close association between refugial areas and postglacial migration routes that insects and host trees have followed in the last 15,000 BP has been suggested in many studies. Finally, a future perspective of how next generation sequencing will influence the resolution of phylogeographic patterns in the coming years is presented. Utilization of such novel techniques will provide a more detailed insight into the genome of scolytids facilitating at the same time the application of neutral and non-neutral markers. The latter markers in particular promise to enhance the study of eco-physiological reaction types like the so-called pioneer beetles or obligate diapausing individuals.},

The model simulates fire and succession on fine scale landscapes for land management applications. It simulates vegetation development as a deterministic process by changing the species composition and stand structure assigned to a polygon. Disturbance initiation is modeled stochastically and disturbance effects are based on the current vegetation conditions of the polygon. Details of all model algorithms are discussed and the model is demonstrated for two applications. Results of an extensive sensitivity and model behavior analysis are also presented.},

abstract = {The Atat{\"{u}}rk Dam is the fourth largest clay-cored rock fill dam in the world. It was constructed on the Euphrates River located in semi-arid Southeastern Turkey in the 1980s as the central component of a large-scale regional development project for the Southeastern Anatolia region (referred to as GAP). The construction began in 1983 and was completed in 1990. The dam and the hydroelectric power plant, which went into service after filling up the reservoir was accomplished in 1992. The Atat{\"{u}}rk Dam, which has a height of 169 m, a total storage capacity of 48.7 million m3, and a surface area of about 817 km2 plays an important role in the development of Turkey's energy and agriculture sectors. In this study, the spatial and temporal impacts of the Atat{\"{u}}rk Dam on agro-meteorological aspects of the Southeastern Anatolia region have been investigated. Change detection and environmental impacts due to water-reserve changes in Atat{\"{u}}rk Dam Lake have been determined and evaluated using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imageries and meteorological datasets within a period of 1984 to 2011. These time series have been evaluated for three time periods. Dam construction period constitutes the first part of the study. Land cover/use changes especially on agricultural fields under the Atat{\"{u}}rk Dam Lake and its vicinity have been identified between the periods of 1984 to 1992. The second period comprises the 10-year period after the completion of filling up the reservoir in 1992. At this period, Landsat and meteorological time-series analyses are examined to assess the impact of the Atat{\"{u}}rk Dam Lake on selected irrigated agricultural areas. For the last 9-year period from 2002 to 2011, the relationships between seasonal water-reserve changes and irrigated plains under changing climatic factors primarily driving vegetation activity (monthly, seasonal, and annual fluctuations of rainfall rate, air temperature, humidity) on the watershed have been investigated using a 30-year meteorological time series. For all images, geometric corrections including digital elevation information and Tasseled Cap transformations were carried out to attain changes in surface reflectance and denoting disturbance of Landsat reflectance data. Consequently, thematic maps of the affected areas were created by using appropriate visualization and classification techniques in conjunction with geographical information system. The resulting dataset was used in a linear trend analysis to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation-cover development. Analysis has been conducted in ecological units that have been determined by climate and land cover/use. Based on the results of the trend analysis and the primary factor analysis, selected parts of South-eastern Anatolia region are analyzed. The results showed that approximately 368 km2 of agricultural fields have been affected because of inundation due to the Atat{\"{u}}rk Dam Lake. However, irrigated agricultural fields have been increased by 56.3{\%} of the total area (1552 km2 of 2756km2) on Harran Plain within the period of 1984 - 2011. This study presents an effective method for time-series analysis that can be used to regularly monitor irrigated fields in the Southeastern Anatolia region.},

abstract = {Despite the large number of in situ, plot-level phenological measurements and satellite-derived phenological studies, there has been little success to date in merging these records temporally or spatially. In this research, we bridge this scale gap through higher resolution satellite records (Landsat) and quantify the accuracy of satellite-derived metrics with direct field measurements. We compiled fifty-seven Landsat scenes from southern New England (P12 R51) from 1984 to 2002. Green vegetation areal abundance for each scene was derived from spectral mixture analysis and a single set of endmembers. The leaf area signal was fit with a logistic-growth simulating sigmoid curve to derive phenological markers (half-maximum leaf-onset and offset). Spring leaf-onset dates in homogenous stands of deciduous forests displayed significant and persistent local variability. The local variability was validated with multiple springtime ground observations (r2 = 0.91). The highest degree of verified small-scale variation occurred where contiguous forests displayed leaf-onset gradients of 10-14 days over short distances ({\textless} 500 m). These dramatic gradients occur in of low-relief ({\textless} 40 m) upland regions. The patterns suggest that microclimates resulting from springtime cold-air drainage may be influential in governing the start of leaf growth; every 4.16 m loss in elevation delayed spring leaf onset by 1 day. These microclimates may be of crucial importance in interpreting in situ records and interpolating phenology from satellite data. Regional patterns from the Landsat analyses suggest topographic, coastal, and land-use controls on phenology. Our results indicate that deciduous forests in the Providence, RI metropolitan area leaf out 5-7 days earlier than comparable rural areas. The platform-independent curve-fit methodology may be extended across platforms and field data.

abstract = {Many indicators and criteria have been proposed to assess the sustainable management of forests but their scientific validity remains uncertain. Because the effects of forest disturbances (such as logging) are often specific to particular species, sites, landscapes, regions and forest types, management "shortcuts" such as indicator species, focal species and threshold levels of vegetation cover may be of limited generic value. We propose an alternative approach based on a set of five guiding principles for biodiversity conservation that are broadly applicable to any forested area: (1) the maintenance of connectivity; (2) the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity; (3) the maintenance of stand structural complexity; and (4) the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem integrity; (5) the use of natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance regimes. We present a checklist of measures for forest biodiversity conservation that reflects the multi-scaled nature of conservation approaches on forested land. At the regional scale, management should ensure the establishment of large ecological reserves. At the landscape scale, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) protected areas within production forests; (2) buffers for aquatic ecosystems; (3) appropriately designed and located road networks; (4) the careful spatial and temporal arrangement of harvest units; and (5) appropriate fire management practices. At the stand level, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) the retention of key elements of stand structural complexity (e.g., large living and dead trees with hollows, understorey thickets, and large fallen logs); (2) long rotation times (coupled with structural retention at harvest); (3) silvicultural systems alternative to traditional high impact ones (e.g., clearcutting in some forest types); and (4) appropriate fire management practices and practices for the management of other kinds of disturbances. Although the general ecological principles and associated checklist are intuitive, data to evaluate the effectiveness of many specific on-the-ground management actions are limited. Considerable effort is needed to adopt adaptive management "natural experiments" and monitoring to: (1) better identify the impacts of logging operations and other kinds of management activities on biodiversity, and; (2) quantify the effectiveness of impact mitigation strategies; and (3) identify ways to improve management practices. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Vigor decreased as both tree density (basal area) and leaf area index increased. Low vigor trees were more often attacked by beetles than high vigor trees. Attacks increased below a vigor threshold of about 100 g of wood produced per square meter of leaf area per year, corresponding in this study to a basal area of 21 m 2 ha - • or a leaf area index of 2.9 m 2 m -2.

Dendroctonus ponderosae, Pinus ponderosa, tree mortality, thinning, stocking. MOUNTAIN PINE BEETLE (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk.) is a tree-killing bark beetle that attacks several pine species in western North America (McCambridge and others 1979). Extensive outbreaks are now occurring in 80-to 120-year-old stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas var. latifolia Engelmanni) (Saf-ranyik and others 1975, Cole and Amman 1980). Although widespread outbreaks have also occurred in old-growth stands of ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa Laws.) (Blackman 1931, Parker and Stevens 1979), most recent outbreaks have been recorded in pole-sized second-growth stands (Sartwell and Stevens 1975). The importance of host condition for successful attacks by mountain pine beetle has been repeatedly mentioned (e.g., Safranyik and others 1975, Berryman 1976, Cole and Amman 1980), although the mechanisms involved were not understood. Several studies have suggested that low vigor trees, although imprecisely defined, are the most susceptible (Sartwell and Stevens 1975, Berryman 1976, Schenk and others 1980). Raffa and Berryman (1981) suggested that the quantity of mono-terpenes produced in response to fungal inoculation was actually an index of vigor, and Mahoney (1978) illustrated some correlations between attack and periodic The authors are, respectively, Research Associate, Division of Forest Entomology, Swedish Uni-versity of Agricultural Sciences, P.O.

abstract = {Analyses of various biophysical and biochemical factors affecting plant canopy reflectance have been carried out over the past few decades, yet the relative importance of these factors has not been adequately addressed. A combination of field and modeling techniques were used to quantify the relative contribution, of leaf, stem, and litter optical properties (incorporating known variation in foliar biochemical properties) and canopy structural attributes to nadir-viewed vegetation reflectance data. Variability in tissue optical properties was wavelength-dependent. For green foliage, the lowest variation was in the visible (VIS) spectral region and the highest in the near-infrared (NIR). For standing litter material, minimum variation occurred in the VIS/NIR, while the largest differences were observed in the shortwave-IR (SWIR). Woody stem material showed opposite trends, with lowest variation in the SWIR and highest in the NIR. Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (LAD) were the dominant controls on canopy reflectance data with the exception of soil reflectance and vegetation cover in sparse canopies. Leaf optical properties (and thus foliar chemistry) were expressed most directly at the canopy level in the NIR, but LAI and LAD strongly controlled the relationship between leaf and canopy spectral characteristics. Stem material played a small but significant role in determining canopy reflectance in woody plant canopies, especially those with LAI{\textless}5.0. Standing litter significantly affected the reflectance characteristics of grassland canopies; small increases in the percentage of standing litter had a disproportionately large affect on canopy reflectance. The structural attributes of ecosystems determine the relative contribution of tissue, canopy, and landscape factors that drive variation in a reflectance signal. Deconvolution of these factors requires an understanding of the sources of variance at each scale (which is ecosystem dependent) as well as an adequate sampling (spectral, angular, and temporal) of the shortwave (400-2500 nm) spectrum.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a few issues that are fundamental for the understanding of vegetation-topography relations: scale dependency, seasonal variability, and importance of observing individual properties. Particularly, it uses two statistical tools - Pearson's r and Moran's I - to define relationships of several topographic attributes with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), and their seasonal changes (from May to July and then September) in the Mediterranean-type landscape of the Santa Monica Mountains, California. The analyses are conducted at both the original data resolution and 20 aggregated resolutions, covering a total range of 30??m to 1500??m, so that topography-vegetation relationships can be compared at different scales. Large sample sizes have supported the significance of the following main findings for this landscape. First, elevation, slope, and southness are the most relevant primary topographic attributes among the tested attributes and their importance changes across seasons. Second, NDVI, NDII, and their seasonal variations have notably different relationships (including no relationship) with topography. Third, the observed topography-vegetation correlations (r) tend to change - typically increase - with the coarsening of spatial scale. Lastly, the spatial autocorrelation of vegetation variables and topographic attributes are often comparable, and the comparability is more apparent when topography-vegetation correlations are stronger. In all, the topography-NDVI/NDII relations defined in this paper may improve the understanding of the multi-scale and property-specific role that mountain topography plays in the formation and seasonal change of vegetation patterns. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A new quantitative method of morphostructure delimitation based on targeted morphometric analyses and multivariate statistical methods was applied to the Western Carpathians. Nine specific morphostructural regions and sixteen subregions were defined as an improvement on the preceding qualitative subdivision of the area. The integration of geodynamics into the targeted morphometric analysis represents a prerequisite for better interpretability of the delimited regions. The new subdivision of the Western Carpathians therefore reflects first of all the Pliocene-Quaternary geodynamics that controls the development of the present-day relief. The results also help to understand the timing of the basic dome-like morphostructural formation of the Western Carpathians (which began 4-6. million years ago, with the main stage continuing until the Late Pliocene and accelerated uplift taking place since the Middle Pleistocene), as well as the mechanism of its formation. The importance of the Middle Miocene extension for the development of the basin-and-mountain mosaic unique to the Western Carpathians is documented. The projection of the older structural boundaries into the new morphostructural regions and the increasing prevalence of the young morpholineament systems (N-S and W-E) on the southern and northern periphery of the Western Carpathians could be an indication of the gradual spreading of the Western Carpathians into the surrounding lowlands during the last stage of the morphotectonic development. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The on-going mountain pine beetle outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has reached historic proportions. There is an operational need for efficient and cost-effective methods to identify red attack trees in these areas. In this paper, we examine the use of an unsupervised clustering 4-m multispectral IKONOS imagery for the detection of mountain pine beetle red attack at sites with low and medium levels of attack. Independent validation data were collected from aerial photography and were used to determine the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery. Concentric buffers, in 1-m increments to a maximum of 4 m, were applied to red attack pixels to characterize attribute accuracy as a function of positional accuracy. When a one-pixel buffer (4 m) is applied, the accuracy with which mountain pine beetle red attack could be detected using the multispectral IKONOS imagery was 71{\%} (low attack) and 92{\%} (medium attack). Analysis of red attack trees that were omitted in the analysis of the multispectral IKONOS image indicated that detection of red attack was most effective for larger tree crowns (diameter {\textgreater} 1.5 m) that were less than 11 m from other red attack trees. These results demonstrate that the unsupervised classification of mountain pine beetle red attack using multispectral IKONOS imagery is an operationally viable approach.},

abstract = {Facial expression plays a key role in non-verbal face-to-face communication. It is a challenging task to develop an automatic facial expression reading and understanding system, especially, for recognizing the facial expression from a static image without any prior knowledge of the test subject. In this paper, we present a topographic modeling approach to recognize and analyze facial expression from single static images. The so-called topographic modeling is developed based on a novel facial expression descriptor, Topographic Context (TC), for representing and recognizing facial expressions. This proposed approach applies topographic analysis that treats the image as a 3D surface and labels each pixel by its terrain features. Topographic context captures the distribution of terrain labels in the expressive regions of a face. It characterizes the distinct facial expression while conserving abundant expression information and disregarding most individual characteristics. Experiments on person-dependent and person-independent facial expression recognition using two public databases (MMI and Cohn-Kanade database) show that TC is a good feature representation for recognizing basic prototypic expressions. Furthermore, we conduct the separability analysis of TC-based features by both a visualized dimensionality reduction example and a theoretical estimation using certain separability criterion. For an in-depth understanding of the recognition property of different expressions, the between-expression discriminability is also quantitatively evaluated using the separability criterion. Finally, we investigated the robustness of the extracted TC-based expression features in two aspects: the robustness to the distortion of detected face region and the robustness to different intensities of facial expressions. The experimental results show that our system achieved the best correct rate at 82.61{\%} for the person-independent facial expression recognition. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Availability of free, high quality Landsat data portends a new era in remote sensing change detection. Using dense ({\~{}}. annual) Landsat time series (LTS), we can now characterize vegetation change over large areas at an annual time step and at the spatial grain of anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally, we expect more accurate detection of subtle disturbances and improved characterization in terms of both timing and intensity. For Landsat change detection in this new era of dense LTS, new detection algorithms are required, and new approaches are needed to calibrate those algorithms and to examine the veracity of their output. This paper addresses that need by presenting a new tool called TimeSync for syncing algorithm and human interpretations of LTS. The tool consists of four components: (1) a chip window within which an area of user-defined size around an area of interest (i.e., plot) is displayed as a time series of image chips which are viewed simultaneously, (2) a trajectory window within which the plot spectral properties are displayed as a trajectory of Landsat band reflectance or index through time in any band or index desired, (3) a Google Earth window where a recent high-resolution image of the plot and its neighborhood can be viewed for context, and (4) an Access database where observations about the LTS for the plot of interest are entered. In this paper, we describe how to use TimeSync to collect data over forested plots in Oregon and Washington, USA, examine the data collected with it, and then compare those data with the output from a new LTS algorithm, LandTrendr, described in a companion paper (Kennedy et al., 2010). For any given plot, both TimeSync and LandTrendr partitioned its spectral trajectory into linear sequential segments. Depending on the direction of spectral change associated with any given segment in a trajectory, the segment was assigned a label of disturbance, recovery, or stable. Each segment was associated with a start and end vertex which describe its duration. We explore a variety of ways to summarize the trajectory data and compare those summaries derived from both TimeSync and LandTrendr. One comparison, involving start vertex date and segment label, provides a direct linkage to existing change detection validation approaches that rely on contingency (error) matrices and kappa statistics. All other comparisons are unique to this study, and provide a rich set of means by which to examine algorithm veracity. One of the strengths of TimeSync is its flexibility with respect to sample design, particularly the ability to sample an area of interest with statistical validity through space and time. This is in comparison to the use of existing reference data (e.g., field or airphoto data), which, at best, exist for only parts of the area of interest, for only specific time periods, or are restricted thematically. The extant data, even though biased in their representation, can be used to ascertain the veracity of TimeSync interpretation of change. We demonstrate that process here, learning that what we cannot see with TimeSync are those changes that are not expressed in the forest canopy (e.g., pre-commercial harvest or understory burning) and that these extant reference datasets have numerous omissions that render them less than desirable for representing truth. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {The widespread outbreaks of Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) are responsible for infestations of lodgepole pine forests since 1990 in Canada. In British Columbia, this forest insect disturbance has resulted in losses of more than 13 million hectares of pine trees. The complexity of the MPB emergence, aggregation and attack behaviour is captured by this study, using an intelligent agent-based model (ABM) of beetle outbreaks at a local scale of individual trees. Agent-based approach permits simulation of interactions that describe the ecological context in which insect populations spread. Intelligent reasoning is introduced by a swarm intelligence (SI) algorithm integrated with theABMthat depicts indirect communication, collective behaviour and self-organized aggregation of insects in a forest ecosystem. The objectives of this study are the following: 1) to develop ForestSimMPB model that integrates SI andABM within a geographic information systems (GIS) framework; 2) to implement the proposed model on real datasets to simulate the MPB aggregation and mass attacks on lodgepole pine trees; and 3) to determine the spatial patterns and extents of these attacks. The ForestSimMPB is calibrated by fine tuning two model parameters, and implemented using data from three sites located in the Cariboo Regional District in the central interior of BC. The obtained results demonstrate the aggregation behaviour ofMPB to collectively attack lodgepole pines, as well as portray the spatial clustering of dead trees resulting from infestation. Simulation outputs provide analysis and predictions of spatial patterns in the forest landscape structure as a result of a MPB outbreak. The developed model can be used to assist the improvement of methods for prevention and control of MPB disturbances.},

abstract = {In The Netherlands, insect pests on trees and shrubs are being monitored continuously since 1946. During these years, almost all insect pest populations showed marked changes, which may be the result of changes in forest management, shifts in forest composition, climate change and the arrival of new pests from the Mediterranean region or from other continents. In order to generate hypothesis about possible relationships between species ecology and environmental factors, we have analyzed 61 years of population development of the 98 most abundant species in the database while paying attention to life history traits and preferred host plants. The 22 species with infestations lasting a few years only were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 76 species, 18 were present over the entire observation period of 61 years. Of the other species, 27 showed a decline and 31 showed an increase. On coniferous trees most species showed decreasing populations. Increasing populations were found most on deciduous trees. Not directly climate-related factors such as changes in forest age, tree composition and forest management were identified as the most important causes for the fluctuations in pest insect populations. Climate change is a possible driver of the population increase in Thaumetopoea processionea, Haematoloma dorsatum and of the population decrease in Euproctis chrysorrhoea. The recently increasing exotic species Eupulvinaria hydrangeae and Pulvinaria regalis were exclusively found on trees in cities, presumably in relation to the higher temperatures of the urban habitat. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Every year, forest fires cause enormous damage to vegetation and fauna, environment and property and bind significant human resources. Particularly in national parks and nature reservations, unique areas of high degree of protection can be devastated by fire. For instance, during the destructive forest fire in the Slovak Paradise National Park (Slovakia) in 1976, very unique vegetation was destroyed in the Kyse Gorge, where the recovery into the former state will take 200 years [1]. Until now (thirty years after the fire), this locality is closed for tourists because of the vast damage. The topic of a lot of projects is how to prevent such disasters. Our research institute is oriented on GRID computing. A lot of international projects oriented on natural disasters utilise grid computing and within grid solution raises requirement of visualization service for presentation of the intermediate or final results. The basic aim of our research is to create a visual service for modelling and 3D rendering of natural disasters, before fire, flood and landslides. Changing the input data of fires spread used to generate new outputs very quickly. Grid computing on a lot of Clusters and 3D visualisation service can allow new scenes of fire spread. Outputs are used for far adjustment to liquidation fires or floods and landslides. {\textcopyright} 2008 WIT Press.},

abstract = {1. The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) is one of the most important forest pests in Central Europe, but despite this the effects of temperature on life history and population growth are largely unknown. This study examines the effects of temperature on reproduction and intrinsic demographic statistics.2. Laboratory experiments on oviposition were carried out at six temperatures in the range 12-33 degrees C, using the so-called sandwich rearing technique for bark beetles.3. A linear relationship between oviposition rates and temperatures in the range 15-25 degrees C was used to estimate the lower temperature threshold for oviposition as 11.4 degrees C. With a nonlinear model fitted to the data across the whole range of experimental temperatures, the lower and upper limiting temperatures and optimum temperature were found to be 7.9, 33.7, and 28.9 degrees C, respectively. A model for daily oviposition rate was fitted, which describes the pattern of oviposition over the entire oviposition period.4. The analysis of life tables, combining developmental rates, reproduction, mortality, and sex ratio, suggests maximum population growth (r(m)) at near 30 degrees C.5. After generating a first brood, spruce bark beetles often re-emerge from the tree and produce other sister broods. The effects of temperature and number of sister broods on demography were evaluated using age-specific life-table analyses. It is hypothesized that sister broods play an important role in regions where I. typographus is monovoltine, but have only moderate significance where this species has more than one generation per season.},

abstract = {Accurate spatial information on the location and extent of mountain pine beetle infestation is critical for the planning of mitigation and treatment activities. Areas of mixed forest and variable terrain present unique challenges for the detection and mapping of mountain pine beetle red-attack damage, as red-attack has a more heterogeneous distribution under these conditions. In this study, mountain pine beetle red-attack damage was detected and mapped using a logistic regression approach with a forward stepwise selection process and a set of calibration data representing samples of red-attack and non-attack from the study area. Variables that were considered for inclusion in the model were the enhanced wetness difference index (EWDI) derived from a time series of Landsat remotely sensed imagery, elevation, slope, and solar radiation (direct, diffuse, and global). The output from the logistic regression was a continuous probability surface, which indicated the likelihood of red-attack damage. Independent validation data were used to assess the accuracy of the resulting models. The final model predicted red-attack damage with an accuracy of 86{\%}. These results indicate that for this particular site, with mixed forest stands and variable terrain, remotely sensed and ancillary spatial data can be combined, through logistic regression, to create a mountain pine beetle red-attack likelihood surface that accurately identifies damaged forest stands. The use of a probabilistic approach reduces dependence upon the definition of change by the application of thresholds (upper and lower bounds of change) at the image processing stage. Rather, a change layer is generated that may be interpreted liberally or conservatively, depending on the information needs of the end user. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Catastrophic events share characteristic nonlinear behaviors that are often generated by cross-scale interactions and feedbacks among system elements. These events result in surprises that cannot easily be predicted based on information obtained at a single scale. Progress on catastrophic events has focused on one of the following two areas: nonlinear dynamics through time without an explicit consideration of spatial connectivity or spatial connectivity and the spread of contagious processes without a consideration of cross- scale interactions and feedbacks. These approaches rarely have ventured beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. We provide an interdisciplinary, conceptual, and general mathe- matical framework for understanding and forecasting nonlinear dynamics through time and across space. We illustrate the gener- ality and usefulness of our approach by using new data and recasting published data from ecology (wildfires and desertification), epidemiology (infectious diseases), and engineering (structural failures).Weshow that decisions that minimize the likelihood of catastrophic events must be based on cross-scale interactions, and such decisions will often be counterintuitive. Given the con- tinuing challenges associated with global change, approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries to include interactions and feedbacks at multiple scales are needed to increase our ability to predict catastrophic events and develop strategies for minimizing their occurrence and impacts. Our framework is an important step in developing predictive tools and designing experiments to examine cross-scale interactions.},

abstract = {Tree-killing bark beetles are widely studied at epidemic population densities because of their significant impacts on forests. At endemic levels, these species are restricted to poorly defended resources, such as wind-felled, lightning-struck, or suppressed trees. It is poorly understood how these scattered and unpredictable resources are discovered and exploited. In this prospect, the collective foraging shown by most bark beetles, in the form of independent searching by individual beetles combined with mutual attention to each other's chemical signals, represents an efficient strategy to increase the probability to discover the resources. In order to explore the role of host distribution and collective foraging on the discovery of and settlement on wind-felled trees by bark beetles at endemic population densities, we developed a spatially explicit foraging model for the major forest pest in Europe, Ips typographus. The model is based on the diffusion of the beetles, the landing of pioneers on wind-felled trees realistically distributed based on field observations in southern Belgium, and the response of flying beetles to pheromones emitted by these pioneers. The results show that social foraging effectively increases the proportion of beetles that landed on wind-felled resources compared to solitary foragers. Furthermore, the model highlights the parameters that influenced the foraging strategy of I. typographus and that need narrower quantification in further experiments. Finally, in the frame of the tested parameters, the model highlights the existence of thresholds in the reproduction rate and in the size of the starting population under which populations collapse. If confirmed, this prediction would shed new light on the understanding of foraging at low, endemic population levels.},

@phdthesis{Dworschak2013,
abstract = {Bark beetles (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) are of fundamental importance for forest ecosystems. They are among the first in decomposing wood of dying or recently died trees and are an important rejuvenating agent in natural forests. By creating dead wood and forest gaps they facilitate fungal, insect and plant diversity (M{\"{u}}ller et al., 2008; M{\"{u}}ller et al., 2010; Wermelinger, 2004). The subfamily Scolytinae comprises wood boring species, the ambrosia beetles, which feed on associated fungi, and subcortical feeding species, the bark beetles (Kirkendall, 1983; Rudinsky, 1962). The Scolytinae include mono- and polyphagous species, which all have certain adaptations to their hosts regarding preference for tree age, bark thickness, branches, roots or cones. Most of the more than 5800 ambrosia and bark beetle species described worldwide (Wood and Bright Jr., 1992) prefer dead or weakened host trees in endemic conditions, and do not even attack healthy trees when population densities are high (Rudinsky, 1962). However, probably less than a dozen species, mainly in the genera Dendroctonus of America and Ips of America and Europe, can attack and kill vigorous trees when in epidemic population phases (Franceschi et al., 2005; Rudinsky, 1962). The small number of species capable of tree-killing might indicate a low functional redundancy (M{\"{u}}ller et al., 2008) and thus highlights their importance for the ecosystem function they provide. Aggressive species can kill extensive areas of trees in epidemic conditions (Berryman, 1982), most remarkable in forests shaped by human activity. For example, the mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins killed 80 million pine trees between 1979 and 1983 (McGregor, 1985). It damaged 25 million ha of pine forests in the last decade alone (Bentz et al., 2010). The southern pine beetle D. frontalis Zimmerman killed more than 17 million m3 pines in North America (Hoffard, 1985). In Europe, the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus Linneaus is the most aggressive scolytid species (Rudinsky, 1962). I. typographus larvae and imagines feed on the secondary phloem almost exclusively of Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) Karsten (Coniferales, Pinaceae) (Postner, 1974). Its distribution ranges across the whole of Europe as far as East Asia and is closely related to that of P. abies (Postner, 1974; Sall{\'{e}} et al., 2007). Apart from their important ecosystem function and complex population dynamics which make them generally interesting for ecologists and biologists alike, the damage bark beetles have caused in economically used forests in the last decades has facilitated extensive research.},

abstract = {This paper explores the prospects for combining elements of the ecological and policy sciences to form a substantive and effective science of ecological policy design. This exploration is made through a case study whose specific focus is the management problem posed by competition between man and an insect (the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana) for utilization of coniferous forests in the Canadian Province of New Brunswick. We used this case study as a practical testing ground in which we examined the relative strengths, weaknesses, and complementarities of various aspects of the policy design process. Where existing approaches proved wanting, we sought to develop alternatives and to test them in turn. In particular, we used a combination of simulation modeling and topological approaches to analyze the space-time dynamics of this ecosystem under a variety of natural and managed conditions. Explicit consideration was given to the development of invalidation tests for establishing the limits of model credibility. An array of economic, social, and environmental indicators was generated by the model, enabling managers and policy makers to evaluate meaningfully the performance of the system under a variety of management proposals. Simplified versions of the models were constructed to accomodate several optimization procedures, including dynamic programming, which produced trial policies for a range of possible objectives. These trial policies were tested in the more complex model versions and heuristically modified in dialogue with New Brunswick's forest managers. We explored the role of utility functions for simplifying and contrasting policy performance measures, paying special attention to questions of time preferences and discounting. Finally, the study was shaped by a commitment to transfer the various models and policy design capabilities from their original academic setting to the desks and minds of the practicing managers and politicians. An array of workshops, model gaming sessions, and nontraditional communication formats was developed and tested in pursuit of this goal. This paper reports some specific management policies developed, and some general lessons for ecological policy design learned in the course of the study.},

abstract = {Long House Valley in the Black Mesa area of northeastern Arizona (U.S.) was inhabited by the Kayenta Anasazi from about 1800 before Christ to about anno Domini 1300. These people were prehistoric ancestors of the modern Pueblo cultures of the Colorado Plateau. Paleoenvironmental research based on alluvial geomorphology, palynology, and dendroclimatology permits accurate quantitative reconstruction of annual fluctuations in potential agricultural production (kg of maize per hectare). The archaeological record of Anasazi farming groups from anno Domini 200-1300 provides information on a millennium of sociocultural stasis, variability, change, and adaptation. We report on a multiagent computational model of this society that closely reproduces the main features of its actual history, including population ebb and flow, changing spatial settlement patterns, and eventual rapid decline. The agents in the model are monoagriculturalists, who decide both where to situate their fields as well as the location of their settlements. Nutritional needs constrain fertility. Agent heterogeneity, difficult to model mathematically, is demonstrated to be crucial to the high fidelity of the model.},

abstract = {This paper examines the potential of MODIS-NDVI time series for detecting clear-cuts in a coniferous forest stand in the south of France. The proposed approach forms part of a survey monitoring the status of forest health and evaluating the forest decline phenomena observed over the last few decades. One of the prerequisites for this survey was that a rapid and easily reproducible method had to be developed that differentiates between forest clear-cuts and changes in forest health induced by environmental factors such as summer droughts. The proposed approach is based on analysis of the breakpoints detected within NDVI time series, using the “Break for Additive Seasonal and Trend” (BFAST) algorithm. To overcome difficulties detecting small areas on the study site, we chose a probabilistic approach based on the use of a conditional inference tree. For model calibration, clear-cut reference data were produced at MODIS resolution (250 m). According to the magnitude of the detected breakpoints, probability classes for the presence of clear-cuts were defined, from greater than 90{\%} to less than 3{\%} probability of a clear-cut. One of the advantages of the probabilistic model is that it allows end users to choose an acceptable level of uncertainty depending on the application. In addition, the use of BFAST allows events to be dated, thus making it possible to perform a retrospective analysis of decreases in forest vitality in the study area.},

abstract = {The proliferation and ubiquity of temporal data across many disciplines has generated substantial interest in the analysis and mining of time series. Clustering is one of the most pop- ular data mining methods, not only due to its exploratory power, but also as a preprocessing step or subroutine for other techniques. In this paper, we present k-Shape, a novel algorithm for time-series clustering. k-Shape relies on a scal- able iterative refinement procedure, which creates homoge- neous and well-separated clusters. As its distance measure, k-Shape uses a normalized version of the cross-correlation measure in order to consider the shapes of time series while comparing them. Based on the properties of that distance measure, we develop a method to compute cluster centroids, which are used in every iteration to update the assignment of time series to clusters. To demonstrate the robustness of k-Shape, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our approach against partitional, hierarchical, and spec- tral clustering methods, with combinations of the most com- petitive distance measures. k-Shape outperforms all scalable approaches in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, k-Shape also outperforms all non-scalable (and hence impractical) com- binations, with one exception that achieves similar accuracy results. However, unlike k-Shape, this combination requires tuning of its distance measure and is two orders of mag- nitude slower than k-Shape. Overall, k-Shape emerges as a domain-independent, highly accurate, and highly efficient clustering approach for time series with broad applications},

abstract = {Landsat can be used to map tropical forest cover at 15–60 m resolution, which is helpful for detecting small but important perturbations in increasingly fragmented forests. However, among the remaining Landsat satellites, Landsat-5 no longer has global coverage and, since 2003, a mechanical fault in the Scan-Line Corrector (SLC-Off) of the Landsat-7 satellite resulted in a 22–25{\%} data loss in each image. Such issues challenge the use of Landsat for wall-to-wall mapping of tropical forests, and encourage the use of alternative, spatially coarser imagery such as MODIS. Here, we describe and test an alternative method of post-classification compositing of Landsat images for mapping over 20.5 million hectares of peat swamp forest in the biodiversity hotspot of Sundaland. In order to reduce missing data to levels comparable to those prior to the SLC-Off error, we found that, for a combination of Landsat-5 images and SLC-off Landsat-7 images used to create a 2005 composite, 86{\%} of the 58 scenes required one or two images, while 14{\%} required three or more images. For a 2010 composite made using only SLC-Off Landsat-7 images, 64{\%} of the scenes required one or two images and 36{\%} required four or more images. Missing-data levels due to cloud cover and shadows in the pre SLC-Off composites (7.8{\%} and 10.3{\%} for 1990 and 2000 enhanced GeoCover mosaics) are comparable to the post SLC-Off composites (8.2{\%} and 8.3{\%} in the 2005 and 2010 composites). The area-weighted producer's accuracy for our 2000, 2005 and 2010 composites were 77{\%}, 85{\%} and 86{\%} respectively. Overall, these results show that missing-data levels, classification accuracy, and geographic coverage of Landsat composites are comparable across a 20-year period despite the SLC-Off error since 2003. Correspondingly, Landsat still provides an appreciable utility for monitoring tropical forests, particularly in Sundaland's rapidly disappearing peat swamp forests.},

abstract = {Supervised land-use/land-cover (LULC) classifications are typically conducted using class assignment rules derived from a set of multiclass training samples. Consequently, classification accuracy varies with the training data set and is thus associated with uncertainty. In this study, we propose a bootstrap resampling and reclassification approach that can be applied for assessing not only the uncertainty in classification results of the bootstrap-training data sets, but also the classification uncertainty of individual pixels in the study area. Two measures of pixel-specific classification uncertainty, namely the maximum class probability and Shannon entropy, were derived from the class probability vector of individual pixels and used for the identification of unclassified pixels. Unclassified pixels that are identified using the traditional chi-square threshold technique represent outliers of individual LULC classes, but they are not necessarily associated with higher classification uncertainty. By contrast, unclassified pixels identified using the equal-likelihood technique are associated with higher classification uncertainty and they mostly occur on or near the borders of different land-cover.},

abstract = {Understanding disturbance interactions and their ecological consequences remains a major challenge for research on the response of forests to a changing climate. When, where, and how one disturbance may alter the severity, extent, or occurrence probability of a subsequent disturbance is encapsulated by the concept of linked disturbances. Here, we evaluated 1) how climate and forest habitat variables, including disturbance history, interact to drive 2000s spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) infestation of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) across the Southern Rocky Mountains; and 2) how previous spruce beetle infestation affects subsequent infestation across the Flat Tops Wilderness in northwestern Colorado, which experienced a severe landscape-scale spruce beetle infestation in the 1940s. We hypothesized that drought and warm temperatures would promote infestation, whereas small diameter and non-host trees, which may reflect past disturbance by spruce beetles, would inhibit infestation. Across the Southern Rocky Mountains, we found that climate and forest structure interacted to drive the 2000s infestation. Within the Flat Tops study area we found that stands infested in the 1940s were composed of higher proportions of small diameter and non-host trees ca. 60 years later. In this area, the 2000s infestation was constrained by a paucity of large diameter host trees ({\textgreater} 23 cm at diameter breast height), not climate. This suggests that there has not been sufficient time for trees to grow large enough to become susceptible to infestation. Concordantly, we found no overlap between areas affected by the 1940s infestation and the current infestation. These results show a severe spruce beetle infestation, which results in the depletion of susceptible hosts, can create a landscape template reducing the potential for future infestations.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to test the possibility of using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for distinguishing between differently managed mountain grassland sites surrounded by boreal forests. The NDVI was assessed under field conditions in three differently managed meadows (mown, mulched, unmanaged), at an altitude of 1150 to 1170 m in the Bohemian Forest Mts. The mowing and mulching were applied to the respective plots in mid-July and three successive NDVI/aboveground biomass assessments were made before and two after the application of the treatments. The presence of litter, expressed by the green ratio index (GR), strongly affected the reflectance of the grassland canopy. The linear relationships between green biomass and NDVI were statistically significant for all treatments only during the period before the application of the treatments. It was only in the unmanaged plot that a statistically significant linear relationship between NDVI and GR was recorded.},

abstract = {Recently, an invasive Asian beetle known as the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Coleoptera: Buprestidae) has emerged as a threat to ash trees in the Midwestern United States and Canada [McCullough, D.G., Katovich, S.A., 2004. Pest Alert: Emerald Ash Borer. United States Forest Service, Northeastern Area. NA-PR-02-04]. Significant infestations in Michigan and nearby areas have all but doomed nearly 1 billion native ash trees. However, surrounding regions may still be able to prevent tree damage from occurring at the scale once inflicted by Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. This paper presents an argument for the establishment of a widely accessible knowledgebase of information on the EABs spread capabilities. We argue that spatial dynamic modeling stands as a flexible and powerful decision support system platform. We present initial simulations of EAB spread scenarios constructed using tree information and land use data collected for DuPage County, IL, an uninfected suburban county in the Chicago metropolitan area. These simulations test policies focused on impeding the costly spread of the beetle. This analysis also presents a framework for further studies assessing the economic impacts on municipalities and counties due to tree removal costs and aesthetic damage. Our work points to human driven movement as the major vector for EAB spread throughout our study area. Here, the focus falls on the ability of state and county implemented firewood quarantines to act as effective policies for slowing EAB spread. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Natural disturbances like wildfire, windthrow and insect outbreaks are critical drivers of composition, structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They are strongly climate-sensitive, and are thus likely to be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest structure and composition associated with management activities such as promoting conifers and increasing standing timber volume (i.e. ‘forest change') also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here, we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed in the same order of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance damage in Europe's forests. Climate change was the main driver of the increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe's forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Summer drought associated with high temperatures recorded in the last few years has given rise to outbreaks of bark beetles developing in weakened host trees. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible weather effect on the biology of and damage caused by Ips typographus L. in the southeastern Alps. The study was carried out recording temperature (1962-2007), precipitation (1922-2007), and the damage caused by I. typographus (1993-2007). In addition, data from pheromone-baited traps (1996-2005) provided information on the main periods of flight activity of I. typographus. From 1922 to 2007, precipitation during March-July has decreased approximately 200 mm (-22{\%}), whereas since 1962-2007, mean temperatures during March-July increased approximately 2 degrees C (+13{\%}). Damage caused by I. typographus was inversely correlated with March-July precipitation from the previous year but not correlated with temperature. Increases in spring temperature did not affect the development timing of the first generation, but only changed its onset. Earlier swarming of both overwintering beetles and first-generation offspring ( approximately 20 d sooner over 10 yr), and the early start of the second generation permitted more complete development of the second brood. Voltinism in this species is discussed in relation to thermal and photoperiodic thresholds, indicating that the occurrence of a third generation is limited by the summer photoperiod rather than by temperature. In conclusion, results suggest that spring drought increases damage caused by I. typographus in the following year, whereas warmer spring affects insect phenology.},

abstract = {In this study, we characterised the temporal-spectral patterns associated with identifying acute-severity disturbances and low-severity disturbances between 1985 and 2011 with the objective to test whether different disturbance agents within these categories can be identified with annual Landsat time series data. We analysed a representative State forest within the Central Highlands which has been exposed to a range of disturbances over the last 30 years, including timber harvesting (clearfell, selective and thinning) and fire (wildfire and prescribed burning). We fitted spectral time series models to annual normal burn ratio (NBR) and Tasseled Cap Indices (TCI), from which we extracted a range of disturbance and recovery metrics. With these metrics, three hierarchical random forest models were trained to 1) distinguish acute-severity disturbances from low-severity disturbances; 2a) attribute the disturbance agents most likely within the acute-severity class; 2b) and attribute the disturbance agents most likely within the low-severity class. Disturbance types (acute severity and low-severity) were successfully mapped with an overall accuracy of 72.9 {\%}, and the individual disturbance types were successfully attributed with overall accuracies ranging from 53.2 {\%} to 64.3 {\%}. Low-severity disturbance agents were successfully mapped with an overall accuracy of 80.2 {\%}, and individual agents were successfully attributed with overall accuracies ranging from 25.5 {\%} to 95.1. Acute-severity disturbance agents were successfully mapped with an overall accuracy of 95.4 {\%}, and individual agents were successfully attributed with overall accuracies ranging from 94.2 {\%} to 95.2 {\%}. Spectral metrics describing the disturbance magnitude were more important for distinguishing the disturbance agents than the post-disturbance response slope. Spectral changes associated with planned burning disturbances had generally lower magnitudes than selective harvesting. This study demonstrates the potential of landsat time series mapping for fire and timber harvesting disturbances at the agent level and highlights the need for distinguishing between agents to fully capture their impacts on ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Increasing awareness of the issue of deforestation and degradation in the tropics has resulted in efforts to monitor forest resources in tropical countries. Advances in satellite-based remote sensing and ground-based technologies have allowed for monitoring of forests with high spatial, temporal and thematic detail. Despite these advances, there is a need to engage communities in monitoring activities and include these stakeholders in national forest monitoring systems. In this study, we analyzed activity data (deforestation and forest degradation) collected by local forest experts over a 3-year period in an Afro-montane forest area in southwestern Ethiopia and corresponding Landsat Time Series (LTS). Local expert data included forest change attributes, geo-location and photo evidence recorded using mobile phones with integrated GPS and photo capabilities. We also assembled LTS using all available data from all spectral bands and a suite of additional indices and temporal metrics based on time series trajectory analysis. We predicted deforestation, degradation or stable forests using random forest models trained with data from local experts and LTS spectral-temporal metrics as model covariates. Resulting models predicted deforestation and degradation with an out of bag (OOB) error estimate of 29{\%} overall, and 26{\%} and 31{\%} for the deforestation and degradation classes, respectively. By dividing the local expert data into training and operational phases corresponding to local monitoring activities, we found that forest change models improved as more local expert data were used. Finally, we produced maps of deforestation and degradation using the most important spectral bands. The results in this study represent some of the first to combine local expert based forest change data and dense LTS, demonstrating the complementary value of both continuous data streams. Our results underpin the utility of both datasets and provide a useful foundation for integrated forest monitoring systems relying on data streams from diverse sources.},

abstract = {Millions of trees killed by bark beetles in western North America have raised concerns about subsequent wildfire, but studies have reported a range of conclusions, often seemingly contradictory, about effects on fuels and wildfire. In this study, we reviewed and synthesized the published literature on modifications to fuels and fire characteristics following beetle-caused tree mortality. We found 39 studies addressing this topic with a variety of methods including fuels measurements, fire behavior simulations, an experiment, and observations of fire occurrence, severity, or frequency. From these publications, we developed a conceptual framework describing expected changes of fuels and fire behavior. Some characteristics of fuels and fire are enhanced following outbreaks and others are unchanged or diminished, with time since outbreak a key factor influencing changes. We also quantified areas of higher and lower confidence in our framework based on the number of studies addressing a particular area as well as agreement among studies. The published literature agrees about responses in many conditions, including fuels measurements and changes in stands with longer times since outbreak, and so we assigned higher confidence to our conceptual framework for these conditions. Disagreement or gaps in knowledge exist in several conditions, particularly in early postoutbreak phases and crown fire behavior responses, leading to low confidence in our framework in these areas and highlighting the need for future research. Our findings resolved some of the controversy about effects of bark beetles on fire through more specificity about time since outbreak and fuels or fire characteristic. Recognition of the type of study question was also important in resolving controversy: some publications assessed whether beetle-caused tree mortality caused differences relative to unattacked locations, whereas other publications assessed differences relative to other drivers of wildfire such as climate. However, some disagreement among studies remained. Given the large areas of recent bark beetle and wildfire disturbances and expected effects of climate change, land and fire managers need more confidence in key areas when making decisions about treatments to reduce future fire hazard and when fighting fires. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forest disturbances around the world have the potential to alter forest type and cover, with impacts on diversity, carbon storage, and landscape composition. These disturbances, especially fire, are common and often large, making ground investigation of forest recovery difficult. Remote sensing offers a means to monitor forest recovery in real time, over the entire landscape. Typically, recovery monitoring via remote sensing consists of measuring vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) or index-derived metrics, with the assumption that recovery in NDVI (for example) is a meaningful measure of ecosystem recovery. This study tests that assumption using MODIS 16-day imagery from 2000 to 2010 in the area of the Colorado's Routt National Forest Hinman burn (2002) and seedling density counts taken in the same area. Results indicate that NDVI is rarely correlated with forest recovery, and is dominated by annual and perennial forb cover, although topography complicates analysis. Utility of NDVI as a means to delineate areas of recovery or non-recovery are in doubt, as bootstrapped analysis indicates distinguishing power only slightly better than random. NDVI in revegetation analyses should carefully consider the ecology and seasonal patterns of the system in question.},

abstract = {1.Unprecedented bark beetle outbreaks have been observed for a variety of forest ecosystems recently, and damage is expected to further intensify as a consequence of climate change. In Central Europe, the response of ecosystem management to increasing infestation risk has hitherto focused largely on the stand level, while the contingency of outbreak dynamics on large-scale drivers remains poorly understood. 2.To investigate how factors beyond the local scale contribute to the infestation risk from Ips typographus (Col., Scol.) we analysed drivers across seven orders of magnitude in scale (from 103 to 1010 m²) over a 23 year period, focusing on the Bavarian Forest National Park. Time-discrete hazard modelling was used to account for local factors and temporal dependencies. Subsequently, beta regression was applied to determine the influence of regional and landscape factors, the latter characterized by means of graph theory. 3.We found that in addition to stand variables large-scale drivers also strongly influenced bark beetle infestation risk. Outbreak waves were closely related to landscape-scale connectedness of both host and beetle populations as well as to regional bark beetle infestation levels. Furthermore, regional summer drought was identified as an important trigger for infestation pulses. Large-scale synchrony and connectivity are thus key drivers of the recently observed unprecedented bark beetle outbreak in the area. 4.Synthesis and applications. Our multi-scale analysis provides evidence that the risk for biotic disturbances is highly dependent on drivers beyond the control of traditional stand-scale management. This finding highlights the importance of fostering the ability to cope with and recover from disturbance. It furthermore suggests that a stronger consideration of landscape and regional processes is needed to address changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management.},

Moreover, current concepts of ecosystem stewardship, such as sustainability and resilience, are inherently scale-dependent. The importance of scale and scaling in the context of forest management is likely to further increase in the future because of the growing relevance of ecosystem services beyond timber production. As a result, a consideration of processes both below (e.g. leaf-level carbon uptake in the context of climate change mitigation) and above (e.g. managing for biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale) the traditional focus on the stand level is required in forest ecosystem management. Furthermore, climate change will affect a variety of ecosystem processes across scales, ranging from photosynthesis (tree organs) to disturbance regimes (landscape scale). Assessing potential climate change impacts on ecosystem services thus requires a multi-scale perspective. However, scaling issues have received comparatively little attention in the forest management community to date. Our objectives here are thus first, to synthesize scaling issues relevant to forest management and second, to elucidate ways of dealing with complex scaling problems by highlighting examples of how they can be addressed with ecosystem models. We have focused on three current management issues of particular importance in European forestry: (1) climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration, (2) multi-functional stand management for biodiversity and non-timber goods and services and (3) improving the resilience to natural disturbances. We conclude that taking into account the full spatiotemporal heterogeneity and dynamics of forest ecosystems in management decision-making is likely to make management more robust to increasing environmental and societal pressures. Models can aid this process through explicitly accounting for system dynamics and changing conditions, operationally addressing the complexity of cross-scale interactions and emerging properties. Our synthesis indicates that increased attention to scaling issues can help forest managers to integrate traditional management objectives with emerging concerns for ecosystem services and therefore deserves more attention in forestry.},

abstract = {Forest disturbance regimes have intensified in many parts of the world in recent decades, and are an increasing problem for managers concerned with the sustainable and continuous provisioning of forest ecosystem services. In order to address these changes an improved understanding of disturbance regimes is needed, particularly with regard to their main drivers and climate sensitivity. Here, our objectives were to first quantitatively describe the recent disturbance regime of forest ecosystems in Austria (3.99??106ha). Second, our aim was to identify the main drivers of the disturbance regime, distinguishing slow, predisposing factors and fast, inciting factors. We utilized district-level disturbance observations from 2002 to 2010, and focused on damage from wind and bark beetles, the most detrimental abiotic and biotic disturbance agents in Europe. In a two-stage approach, we first analyzed the influence of slow, predisposing variables on the spatial variation in mean disturbance damage, using principle component regression. Subsequently, the year-to-year residuals from these average damage levels were regressed against fast, inciting factors related to disturbance occurrence.Overall, this two-stage analysis explained 48.7{\%} (wind) and 67.1{\%} (bark beetles) of the spatio-temporal variation in disturbance damage. On average, wind and bark beetles damaged 0.26{\%} and 0.19{\%} of growing stock per year. The analysis of damaged forest areas suggest a mean disturbance rotation period of 746 and 365. years for wind and bark beetle disturbance. Variables related to species composition were the most influential factors on the predisposition to both disturbance agents. Societal factors were found to be of similar importance as climatic variables. Overall, these predisposing (slow) variables had a stronger influence than inciting (fast) drivers, of which weather-related variables and spatio-temporal interactions within the disturbance regime were the most prominent factors.Our results indicate that important drivers of the disturbance regime can be influenced by forest management directly, but also underline that response times are likely to be slow. Furthermore, fast, inciting factors - although largely beyond the influence of management - have the potential to be used as early warning indicators of impending disturbance damage. Overall, disturbance regimes were found to be highly sensitive to both climate means and extremes, emphasizing the importance for improved risk management in forestry in the face of climate change. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Wind throw is a common disturbance in forest ecosystems. Because many forests are intensively used our knowledge on forest dynamics after such disturbances is limited. In the Bavarian Forest National Park/Germany after the wind throw event in summer 1983, we started our long-term observation in nearly natural Norway spruce forests within 5-year intervals up to 2010. A part of the affected stands was cleared, while another part was left untouched for natural development. Here, we focused on the tree species regeneration, using an individual-based approach. We expected that tree species regeneration in both management types would follow different succession pathways. Indeed, we found different regeneration characteristics, depending on whether the area had been cleared or left unmanaged. For example, for the target species Norway spruce, a chronic regeneration during the first two decades with low numbers, but a high survival rate of individuals, and for the pioneer species birch, pulse regeneration with high numbers of individuals only at the beginning and high individual loss during the following years occurred. Unmanaged and cleared wind throw areas, respectively, offer different quantities of micro-sites: the pit and mound structure as mineral soil disturbance was limited to less than 1/4 in the untouched area, whereas there was mineral soil disturbance more or less everywhere on the cleared parts. Type and intensity of disturbance allow a wide range of succession pathways after wind throw, based on the fundamental processes of germination and competition. Therefore, for protection area management as well as for forest management, the human activity immediately after the event is crucial. Because each management impact will change the succession pathway fundamentally any impact has to be omitted in protection areas with the main goal of natural vegetation succession. Also in managed forests abdication of any impact on small areas may improve the natural structures and biodiversity of forests.},

abstract = {Mountain forests are among the most important ecosystems in Europe as they support numerous ecological, hydrological, climatic, social, and economic functions. They are unique relatively natural ecosystems consisting of long-lived species in an otherwise densely populated human landscape. Despite this, centuries of intensive forest management in many of these forests have eclipsed evidence of natural processes, especially the role of disturbances in long-term forest dynamics. Recent trends of land abandonment and establishment of protected forests have coincided with a growing interest in managing forests in more natural states. At the same time, the importance of past disturbances highlighted in an emerging body of literature, and recent increasing disturbances due to climate change are challenging long-held views of dynamics in these ecosystems. Here, we synthesize aspects of this Special Issue on the ecology of mountain forest ecosystems in Europe in the context of broader discussions in the field, to present a new perspective on these ecosystems and their natural disturbance regimes. Most mountain forests in Europe, for which long-term data are available, show a strong and long-term effect of not only human land use but also of natural disturbances that vary by orders of magnitude in size and frequency. Although these disturbances may kill many trees, the forests themselves have not been threatened. The relative importance of natural disturbances, land use, and climate change for ecosystem dynamics varies across space and time. Across the continent, changing climate and land use are altering forest cover, forest structure, tree demography, and natural disturbances, including fires, insect outbreaks, avalanches, and wind disturbances. Projected continued increases in forest area and biomass along with continued warming are likely to further promote forest disturbances. Episodic disturbances may foster ecosystem adaptation to the effects of ongoing and future climatic change. Increasing disturbances, along with trends of less intense land use, will promote further increases in coarse woody debris, with cascading positive effects on biodiversity, edaphic conditions, biogeochemical cycles, and increased heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Together, this may translate to disturbance-mediated resilience of forest landscapes and increased biodiversity, as long as climate and disturbance regimes remain within the tolerance of relevant species. Understanding ecological variability, even imperfectly, is integral to anticipating vulnerabilities and promoting ecological resilience, especially under growing uncertainty. Allowing some forests to be shaped by natural processes may be congruent with multiple goals of forest management, even in densely settled and developed countries.},

abstract = {The area of land use or land cover change obtained directly from a map may differ greatly from the true area of change because of map classification error. An error-adjusted estimator of area can be easily produced once an accuracy assessment has been performed and an error matrix constructed. The estimator presented is a stratified estimator which is applicable to data acquired using popular sampling designs such as stratified random, simple random and systematic (the stratified estimator is often labeled a poststratified estimator for the latter two designs). A confidence interval for the area of land change should also be provided to quantify the uncertainty of the change area estimate. The uncertainty of the change area estimate, as expressed via the confidence interval, can then subsequently be incorporated into an uncertainty analysis for applications using land change area as an input (e.g., a carbon flux model). Accuracy assessments published for land change studies should report the information required to produce the stratified estimator of change area and to construct confidence intervals. However, an evaluation of land change articles published between 2005 and 2010 in two remote sensing journals revealed that accuracy assessments often fail to include this key information. We recommend that land change maps should be accompanied by an accuracy assessment that includes a clear description of the sampling design (including sample size and, if relevant, details of stratification), an error matrix, the area or proportion of area of each category according to the map, and descriptive accuracy measures such as user's, producer's and overall accuracy. Furthermore, mapped areas should be adjusted to eliminate bias attributable to map classification error and these error-adjusted area estimates should be accompanied by confidence intervals to quantify the sampling variability of the estimated area. Using data from the published literature, we illustrate how to produce error-adjusted point estimates and confidence intervals of land change areas. A simple analysis of uncertainty based on the confidence bounds for land change area is applied to a carbon flux model to illustrate numerically that variability in the land change area estimate can have a dramatic effect on model outputs. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Evidence of shifting dominance among major forest disturbance agent classes regionally to globally has been emerging in the literature. For example, climate-related stress and secondary stressors on forests (e.g., insect and disease, fire) have dramatically increased since the turn of the century globally, while harvest rates in the western US and elsewhere have declined. For shifts to be quantified, accurate historical forest disturbance estimates are required as a baseline for examining current trends. We report annual disturbance rates (with uncertainties) in the aggregate and by major change causal agent class for the conterminous US and five geographic subregions between 1985 and 2012. Results are based on human interpretations of Landsat time series from a probability sample of 7200 plots (30. m) distributed throughout the study area. Forest disturbance information was recorded with a Landsat time series visualization and data collection tool that incorporates ancillary high-resolution data. National rates of disturbance varied between 1.5{\%} and 4.5{\%} of forest area per year, with trends being strongly affected by shifting dominance among specific disturbance agent influences at the regional scale. Throughout the time series, national harvest disturbance rates varied between one and two percent, and were largely a function of harvest in the more heavily forested regions of the US (Mountain West, Northeast, and Southeast). During the first part of the time series, national disturbance rates largely reflected trends in harvest disturbance. Beginning in the mid-90s, forest decline-related disturbances associated with diminishing forest health (e.g., physiological stress leading to tree canopy cover loss, increases in tree mortality above background levels), especially in the Mountain West and Lowland West regions of the US, increased dramatically. Consequently, national disturbance rates greatly increased by 2000, and remained high for much of the decade. Decline-related disturbance rates reached as high as 8{\%} per year in the western regions during the early-2000s. Although low compared to harvest and decline, fire disturbance rates also increased in the early- to mid-2000s. We segmented annual decline-related disturbance rates to distinguish between newly impacted areas and areas undergoing gradual but consistent decline over multiple years. We also translated Landsat reflectance change into tree canopy cover change information for greater relevance to ecosystem modelers and forest managers, who can derive better understanding of forest-climate interactions and better adapt management strategies to changing climate regimes. Similar studies could be carried out for other countries where there are sufficient Landsat data and historic temporal snapshots of high-resolution imagery.},

abstract = {The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of "good practice" recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the "reference classification" will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A historically unprecedented mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak affected western Montana during the past decade. We examined radial growth rates (AD 1860-2007/8) of co-occurring mature healthy and MPB-infected ponderosa pine trees collected at two sites (Cabin Gulch and Kitchen Gulch) in western Montana and: (1) compared basal area increment (BAI) values within populations and between sites; (2) used carbon isotope analysis to calculate intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) at Cabin Gulch; and (3) compared climate-growth responses using a suite of monthly climatic variables. BAI values within populations and between sites were similar until the last 20-30 years, at which point the visually healthy populations had consistently higher BAI values (22-34{\%}) than the MPB-infected trees. These results suggest that growth rates two-three decades prior to the current outbreak diverged between our selected populations, with the slower-growing trees being more vulnerable to beetle infestation. Both samples from Cabin Gulch experienced upward trends in iWUE, with significant regime shifts toward higher iWUE beginning in 1955-59 for the visually healthy trees and 1960-64 for the MPB-infected trees. Drought tolerance also varied between the two populations with the visually healthy trees having higher growth rates than MPB-infected trees prior to infection during a multi-decadal period of drying summertime conditions. Intrinsic water-use efficiency significantly increased for both populations during the past 150 years, but there were no significant differences between the visually healthy and MPB-infected chronologies.},

Changes in survivorship and stand structure characteristics (diameter (DBH), basal area, height, age, and crown length ratio) of nearly 2500 spatially-referenced trees located in 64 long-term survey plots were compared over four time periods that spanned the duration of the outbreak disturbance event. Stand structure characteristics, topographic factors (slope, elevation, and aspect), and solar equinox radiation were tested as predictors of mortality for multiple stages in the outbreak using boosted regression tree modeling. Our findings showed that: (1) spatial synchrony was not reflective of mortality severity; (2) mortality rates increased significantly as the outbreak progressed; (3) the stand's structure was altered significantly by the outbreak (larger trees were killed most frequently); (4) stand structure characteristics were the best predictors of mortality in all stages of the outbreak, though topographic factors and solar equinox radiation also exhibited moderate to strong predictive power in some stages; and (5) stand complexity decreased significantly as the outbreak progressed. This illustrates the inherently complex nature of bark beetle outbreaks on fine spatial scales and suggests that the extent and severity of spruce mortality during an outbreak event is largely dependent on the relative stage of the outbreak and the structure of the stand.},

abstract = {A strong windstorm in November 2004 resulted in a huge blown-down spruce forest area in the southern part of the Tatra National Park in the Western Carpathians in Slovakia, Central Europe. The aim of this work is to study the vegetation composition of spruce forest at differently managed sites four years after this disturbance. Four study areas were selected for this purpose: (i) an area where the fallen trees were extracted and new seedlings were planted; (ii) an area, which was hit by a forest fire after the extraction; (iii) an area where no active management was applied; (iv) a reference forest unaffected by such disturbance. A total of 100 plots were selected, 25 of each area type. The result of DCA and CCA analyses consistently indicated that after this short period the non-extracted and extracted areas are currently most similar to the reference forest area, while the fire affected area differed. A one-way ANOVA comparing species cover for the different plot sizes indicated some significant differences between the extracted and non-extracted plots. The abundance of certain species commonly occurring in spruce forests, such as Dyopteris carthusiana agg., Vaccinium myrtillus and Avenella flexuosa, correlated weli with the non-extracted plots, compared to the extracted plots. Coverage of these species was lowest on burned plots. The lowest Shannon-Wiener's diversity values were recorded in burned plots. This was most likely a consequence of mono-dominant competitive species spread, (mainly Chamerion angustifolium) which profited from the altered ecological conditions following the fire. Although some differences were also registered in the Shannon-Wiener diversity index between the remaining research plots, however these were not statistically significant. The most important results of our investigations include the extensive influence of fire disturbance on vegetation. Study revealed that the wind-disturbed area is able to regenerate sufficiently without human intervention.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Protected areas provide important ecosystem services globally but few studies have examined how cultural differences influence the distribution of cultural ecosystem values and management preferences. We used internet-based public participation GIS (PPGIS) in the countries of Norway and Poland to identify ecosystem values and management preferences in protected areas held by regional residents and site users. We found significant differences in the type and quantity of ecosystem values with Norwegians mapping more values relating to use of resources (e.g., hunting/fishing, gathering) and Polish respondents mapping more environmental values such as scenery, biological diversity, and water quality. With respect to management preferences, Norwegians identified more preferences for resource utilization while Polish respondents identified more preferences for conservation. Norwegian respondents were more satisfied with protected area management and local participation which can be explained by historical, legal, and cultural differences between the two countries. For Norway, biodiversity conservation in protected areas will continue to be guided by sustainable use of protected areas, rather than strict nature protection, with management favoring local board control and active public participation. For Poland, change in protected area management to enhance biodiversity conservation is less certain, driven by national environmental values that conflict with local values and preferences, continuing distrust in government, and low levels of civic participation. Differential efficacy in PPGIS methods - Norway with greater participation from household sampling and Poland with greater response using social media - suggest different strategies will be required for effective public engagement in protected area planning and management.},

abstract = {Questions: What historical natural disturbances have shaped the structure and development of an old-growth, sub-alpine Picea abies forest? Are large-scale, high-severity disturbances (similar to the recent windthrow and bark beetle outbreaks in the region) within the historical range of variability for this forest ecosystem? Can past disturbances explain the previously described gradient in stand structure that had been attributed to an elevation gradient? Location: S. umava National Park (the Bohemian Forest) of the southwest Czech Republic. Methods: We reconstructed the site's disturbance history using dendroecological methods in a 20-ha study plot, established to span an elevation gradient. Growth patterns of 400 increment cores were screened for: (1) abrupt increases in radial growth indicating mortality of a former canopy tree and (2) rapid early growth rates indicating establishment in a former canopy gap. Results: Spatial and temporal patterns of canopy accession varied markedly over the 20-ha study area, resulting in disturbance pulses that corresponded to an elevation gradient. On the lower slope of the plot, the majority of the trees reached the canopy during two pulses (1770-1800 and 1820-1840), while most trees on the upper slope accessed the canopy in one pulse (1840-1860). Historically documented windstorms roughly coincide with peaks in our disturbance reconstruction. Conclusions: Our study provides strong evidence that these forests were historically shaped by infrequent, moderate-to high-severity natural disturbances. Our methods, however, could not definitively identify the agent(s) of these disturbances. Nevertheless, the recent mid-1990s windstorm and the ensuing spruce bark beetle outbreak may provide an analogue for past disturbance, as the duration and severity of these events could easily explain past patterns of growth response and recruitment in our results. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume the interaction of windstorms and bark beetles seen in the contemporary landscape has occurred historically. Finally, our results suggest that the previously documented elevation gradient in forest structure may not be related to elevation per se (lower temperatures and shorter growing season) but rather to changes in disturbance severity mediated by elevation.},

@article{Byers1996,
abstract = {Iterative equations were developed that predict the encounter rate between a population of moving animals and a population of stationary objects, where the animals cease to search upon finding an object. The encounter rate through time depends on the number of searching animals (bark beetles). number of stationary objects (host trees), average speed of the animals, average radius of the object, and area of the search arena. The iterative equations were used in a computer program to vary these parameters with regard to flight dispersal of the bark beetle Ips typographus (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) during their search for susceptible host trees of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Realistic parameters of flight speed, numbers of beetles and susceptible host trees, tree diameters, density of healthy trees, search area, and time searching were held constant while certain of these parameters were varied in computer model runs. In most cases, significant proportions of the modeled bark beetle population (of which individuals fly forward with a random component) found the relatively few susceptible host trees suitable for colonization. Only at very low effective flight speeds (due to longer stays on trees) or with widely distributed hosts of smaller diameter, did relatively few beetles find suitable hosts. Once the 'pioneer' beetles find susceptible hosts, release of aggregation pheromone would greatly increase the effective radius of the host and allow rapid concentration of the population on these trees. The model suggests that primary attraction to host tree volatiles is not mandatory for host finding and selection in many species of bark beetle. Evolution of an olfactory response to host volatiles is more probable in species with low population densities or widely dispersed host plants, or both. Also, there would be little selection pressure on a bark beetle species to evolve aggregation pheromones if they call respond over some meters to plant volatiles that reveal the location of a susceptible host.},

abstract = {To maintain biodiversity in forests more wind-felled trees must be left. However, there is concern among forest owners that this may result in higher tree mortality caused by the spruce bark beetle (SBB). Data from six studies on number of trees killed by the SBB in storm-disturbed stands was analysed. The studies include 16 areas, 2-346 ha in size, where wind-felled spruce trees were left. In one of the studies also stands where all wind-felled trees were removed directly after the storm were included. Few trees were killed in the first summer following the storm disturbance. In most stands the tree mortality peaked already in the second or third summer following the storm. But in five of the stands tree mortality peaked later. The number of trees killed per ha by the SBB varies much between the studied stands. There was a trend that the larger areas experienced on average higher tree mortality per ha than the smaller areas. One of the studies, including six stands, demonstrated an almost perfect correlation between the number of colonised wind-felled trees and the number of killed trees in a 4-year period following the storm disturbance. In the same study the removal of wind-felled trees resulted in a 50{\%} reduction in number of trees killed per ha in the 4-years following the storm.},

Additionally, D. ponderosae larvae in P. mexicanus-infested trees were found to require a significantly lower amount of resource to complete development with no loss in size.  4 The presence of P. mexicanus may affect host condition, improving the subcortical environment for endemic D. ponderosae, ultimately aiding in population maintenance at low levels.

abstract = {Individual-based modelling approaches are being used to simulate larger complex spatial systems in ecology and in other fields of research. Several novel model development issues now face researchers: in particular how to simulate large numbers of individuals with high levels of complexity, given finite computing resources. A case study of a spatially-explicit simulation of aphid population dynamics was used to assess two strategies for coping with a large number of individuals: the use of 'super-individuals' and parallel computing. Parallelisation of the model maintained the model structure and thus the simulation results were comparable to the original model. However, the super-individual implementation of the model caused significant changes to the model dynamics, both spatially and temporally. When super-individuals represented more than around 10 individuals it became evident that aggregate statistics generated from a super-individual model can hide more detailed deviations from an individual-level model. Improvements in memory use and model speed were perceived with both approaches. For the parallel approach, significant speed-up was only achieved when more than five processors were used and memory availability was only increased once five or more processors were used. The super-individual approach has potential to improve model speed and memory use dramatically, however this paper cautions the use of this approach for a density-dependent spatially-explicit model, unless individual variability is better taken into account. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper, we identify two distinct notions of accuracy of land-use models and highlight a tension between them. A model can have predictive accuracy: its predicted land-use pattern can be highly correlated with the actual land-use pattern. A model can also have process accuracy: the process by which locations or land-use patterns are determined can be consistent with real world processes. To balance these two potentially conflicting motivations, we introduce the concept of the invariant region, i.e., the area where land-use type is almost certain, and thus path independent; and the variant region, i.e., the area where land use depends on a particular series of events, and is thus path dependent. We demonstrate our methods using an agent-based land-use model and using multi-temporal land-use data collected for Washtenaw County, Michigan, USA. The results indicate that, using the methods we describe, researchers can improve their ability to communicate how well their model performs, the situations or instances in which it does not perform well, and the cases in which it is relatively unlikely to predict well because of either path dependence or stochastic uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

Future climate change is expected to further intensify disturbance regimes, which makes addressing disturbances in ecosystem management a top priority. As a prerequisite a broader understanding of disturbance impacts and ecosystem responses is needed. With regard to the effects of strong winds – the most detrimental disturbance agent in Europe – monitoring and management has focused on structural damage, i.e., tree mortality from uprooting and stem breakage. Effects on the functioning of trees surviving the storm (e.g., their productivity and allocation) have been rarely accounted for to date.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}        {\textless}/sec{\textgreater}        {\textless}sec{\textgreater}          {\textless}title{\textgreater}Methodology/Principal Findings{\textless}/title{\textgreater}          {\textless}p{\textgreater}Here we show that growth reduction was significant and pervasive in a 6.79{\textperiodcentered}million hectare forest landscape in southern Sweden following the storm Gudrun (January 2005).

abstract = {Correct knowledge of disturbance ecology is essential for understanding the characteristic behavior of forest ecosystems and for guiding appropriate management strategies. However, the role of natural disturbances in shaping European mountain forest ecosystems has not been adequately studied, possibly because of the perception that the development of most European forests is primarily shaped by human influences and/or fine-scale gap-phase dynamics.In the present study, we investigate the long-term disturbance history of old protected forest dominated by Norway spruce in the Parangalitsa Reserve, Bulgaria. We used aerial photo interpretation and dendroecological methods to reconstruct the history of wind, insect, and fire disturbances across a topographically complex landscape. Over the past 150. years wind has been the most important disturbance agent in this ecosystem and at least 18{\%} of the forested area shows evidence of high-severity blowdowns. Windthrow patches ranged in size from {\textless}1. ha to {\textgreater}10. ha (minimum 0.11. ha, mean 0.16. ha, maximum 10. ha). Although small disturbances were much more frequent, few larger blowdowns accounted for most of the disturbed area. Pure coniferous and single-cohort coniferous forest patches were more affected by blowdowns than mixed coniferous-deciduous and multi-cohort coniferous forest patches. Although bark beetle (Ips typhographus) populations were large enough to cause mortality of some live trees, the populations did not grow to epidemic proportions during recent decades. Fire disturbance was of limited importance in the last 200. years and only two patches (4{\%} of the study area) showed evidence of fire.The present research indicates that wind disturbances have been characteristic of these ecosystems at least over the past decades to centuries. Thus, blowdowns appear integral to the normal function and structure of the Picea-dominated mountain forests in the region and such events, in and of themselves, do not represent unhealthy forest conditions or environmental emergencies. Management strategies that aim to maintain these ecosystems within a natural range of variation should incorporate wind disturbances into the management strategy. The frequency and magnitude of future wind disturbances may be considered within the historical framework described in the current study to assess potential effects of climate change on altered disturbance regimes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The weakened or suppressed hosts targeted by tree-killing conifer bark beetles during endemic phases are considered to be poorly defended and available to several competing species. Hosts face trade-offs in the allocation of resources in growth and reproduction or in defense, and the defense/resources status varies with time after host's death or weakening event. Tree-killing bark beetles at endemic levels must choose along a spectrum, compromising between encountering minimal defense and facing high competition, or benefiting from high nutritional quality but facing high host defense. The relationships between resources and defenses in dead/dying trees have not been quantitatively assessed to date, because most studies focus on epidemic conditions. We measured the changes in constitutive and induced defenses in the phloem of spruce trees artificially uprooted at different times (up to 17 months prior to experiment initiation) and treated with methyl-jasmonate (MeJ) in order to induce chemical defense. We measured the effect of these changes on different steps of the host selection process and brood success of a major forest pest in Eurasia, Ips typographus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae).Our results show that uprooted trees maintain some level of constitutive defenses, in particular monoterpenes, that decrease with time after uprooting. Moreover, the trees maintain some inducibility and can produce monoterpenes in response to MeJ treatment up to 7 months after uprooting. These defenses are correlated in part with the energy available in the phloem, but are likely too weak to exert pressure on the beetles' success and selection, the latter being related to the amount of energy available. Our results confirm that wind-felled trees are poorly defended, consistent with the hypothesis of the evolution of the tree-killing behavior from saprophagy in response to an overwhelming interspecific competition on undefended hosts. Wind-felled trees still represent a useful resource, exposing endemic populations of aggressive beetles to low defense levels while facilitating reproduction, growth and development. The constraint on the beetles' populations then becomes the ability to locate these scattered and unpredictable resources.},

abstract = {Disturbances such as storm damage and bark beetle infestations are key factors for the development of forest ecosystems. Infestations of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus), which is the most devastating biotic disturbance agent in forests of central Europe and Scandinavia, are often triggered by storm damage. However, our understanding of spatio-temporal bark beetle dynamics at fine scales is still limited. In order to assess future risks of I. typographus infestations, we analyzed spatial interactions of the infestation pattern in a 180km2 study region in central Switzerland. We computed neighborhood characteristics of bark beetle dispersal and fitted Poisson models to the spatial point patterns of bark beetles and storm damages. Infestations of I. typographus were found to be clustered at short distances ({\textless}500m). In contrast, the spatial distribution of storm damages followed an inhomogeneous Poisson distribution that was explained by environmental covariates. Increasing topographic exposure, south- and west-facing slopes as well as increasing proportions of Norway spruce enhanced the probability of storm damage and bark beetle infestations. Our study is a contribution towards quantifying important ecological drivers in a spatially explicit manner that helps assessing predisposing factors for future bark beetle infestations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) is the most devastating biotic disturbance agent in Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests of Central Europe and Scandinavia. To reduce damage by bark beetles, foresters aim at (i) preventing outbreaks by salvage logging of storm-damaged timber, and (ii) lowering bark beetle damage by sanitation felling of beetle-infested spruce trees. The effectiveness of these measures are controversially discussed but has not yet been thoroughly analyzed on a quantitative basis. We analyzed a survey dataset with annual resolution that covers 9. years and 487 forest districts (82{\%} of the forested area) all over Switzerland to quantify the drivers of bark beetle infestations, in particular salvage logging and sanitation felling. Poisson log-normal models were used to analyze the dynamics of bark beetle infestations at the forest district level.Bark beetle infestations increased with increasing storm damage, heat sum, volume of Norway spruce stock and the number of infestation spots in the previous year. In contrast, infestations decreased with increasing proportions of sanitation felling relative to the total volume of infested spruce, and with increasing proportions of salvaged windthrown spruce.Our study is the first to quantify the combined effects of salvage logging and sanitation felling on the infestation dynamics of I. typographus in subsequent years, thus allowing forest managers to improve management strategies of bark beetle damage. Sanitation felling and salvage logging reduce the emergence of new infestation spots. In regions with large scale storm damage, salvage logging is clearly more urgent than sanitation felling in the first year and it is therefore recommended to prioritize in the first year after storm events. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Chemical ecology of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) was reviewed. The outbreak of I. typographus in central Europe triggered extensive research on chemical ecology. Males initiate host location and produce semiochemicals which attract both males and females. A successful mass attack must first overcome the resistance of the host tree. Pioneer I. typographus evolved to use the resin flow of host trees as kairomones in host location, and synthesized semiochemicals initially to detoxify the resin. If small bark beetle populations in- fest healthy trees, mass attack is prevented by host resistance. Nine monoterpene alcohols were found in male hind-guts, including cis-verbenol (cV) and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MB) which are regarded as primary aggregation pheromones, and a low proportion of Ipsdie- nol (Id) which increases attractiveness of cV and MB. Verbenone (Vn) and Ipsenol (Ie) are anti-aggregation pheromones, that play important roles in adjusting attack density and insect density under the bark. Non-host volatiles are repellent to I. typographus, so that beetles do not waste energy boring into non-host trees. The relationship between host resistance, pheromone compounds and behavior, non-host volatiles, bioassays and mass trapping are reviewed. Results of field bioassays stressed that traps baited with specific pheromones could be used as a reasonable protection measure.},

abstract = {Wind is the most detrimental disturbance agent in Europe's forest ecosystems. In recent years, disturbance frequency and severity have been increasing at continental scale, a trend that is expected to continue under future anthropogenic climate change. Disturbance management is thus increasingly important for sustainable stewardship of forests, and requires tools to evaluate the effects of management alternatives and climatic changes on disturbance risk and ecosystem services. We here present a process-based model of wind disturbance impacts on forest ecosystems, integrated into the dynamic landscape simulation model iLand. The model operates at the level of individual trees and simulates wind disturbance events iteratively, i.e., dynamically accounting for changes in forest structure and newly created edges during the course of a storm. Both upwind gap size and local shelter from neighboring trees are considered in this regard, and critical wind speeds for uprooting and stem breakage are distinguished. The simulated disturbance size, pattern, and severity are thus emergent properties of the model. We evaluated the new simulation tool against satellite-derived data on the impact of the storm Gudrun (January 2005) on a 1391ha forest landscape in south central Sweden. Both the overall damage percentage (observation: 21.7{\%}, simulation: 21.4{\%}) as well as the comparison of spatial damage patterns showed good correspondence between observations and predictions (prediction accuracy: 60.4{\%}) if the full satellite-derived structural and spatial heterogeneity of the landscape was taken into account. Neglecting within-stand heterogeneity in forest conditions, i.e., the state-of-the-art in many stand-level risk models, resulted in a considerable underestimation of simulated damage, supporting the notion that tree-level complexity matters for assessing and modeling large-scale disturbances. A sensitivity analysis further showed that changes in wind speed and soil freezing could have potentially large impacts on disturbed area and patch size. The model presented here is available as open source. It can be used to study the effects of different silvicultural systems and future climates on wind risk, as well as to quantify the impacts of wind disturbance on ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. It thus contributes to improving our capacity to address changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In two hemiboreal mixed spruce-hardwood forests in north-east Estonia, we studied (1) which factors affect tree regeneration survival and development during the first post-storm decade and (2) how these effects change in time. Regeneration height and mortality of the tree species black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) J. Gaertn.), birch (Betula pendula Roth., Betula pubescens Ehrh.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and European rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) were analysed in moderately and heavily damaged stands, in two types of windstorm-created microsites, i.e. root-plate pits and mounds of uprooted trees, and on intact soil at different stages since disturbance. Regeneration was significantly taller in heavily damaged areas and species traits regarding tree height only became noteworthy at later stages since disturbance. Mortality probability was initially indifferent to microsite type and increased later for regeneration on intact soil compared to regeneration on the storm-induced microsites. Mortality increased with storm severity for A. glutinosa and Betula, whereas mortality of P. abies was initially low and became higher with time since disturbance in areas with increased levels of coarse woody debris. Eventually, height and height increment in previous years were clearly negatively related to mortality probability and competition levels in previous years increased chance of death. The relatively high spatial heterogeneity and trends in dominance of post-storm microsites by different tree species increase disturbance-emulating management options. In conclusion, regeneration mortality and species composition are initially directed by exogenous factors linked to storm severity and microsite heterogeneity, generating a degree of spatial partitioning within a microsite, whereas gradually species' life-history traits and competition take over.},

More than 118,000m3 of trees were damaged by wind and bark beetles. The analysis considered the relationship and succession of these two types of disturbances.Discrimination analysis, a multiple linear regression and boosted regression trees were used to determine the influence of 11 variables on tree mortality initiation and severity. The wind- bark beetles disturbance system was primarily influenced by stand related factors. Tree mortality initiation primarily depends on stand age and related changes in Norway spruce size and vitality. Wind caused tree mortality severity was primarily related to the tree or stand characteristics as well. The roles of host and environmental factors in the initiation and severity of tree mortality were influenced by the I. typographus outbreak phase. Stand, site and solar radiation variables were the most important factors impacting tree mortality severity caused by this disturbance system, especially in the epidemic phase. However, the severity of tree mortality caused by wind was primarily correlated with the stand characteristics. With the exception of elevation, the roles of the studied factors were similar in all gradation phases. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract 1 To maintain biodiversity in forests more wind-felled trees must be left where they fall. However, there is concern among forest owners that this may result in higher tree mortality caused by the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.) (Col.: Scolytidae).2 In the 5 years following a major storm disturbance the number of standing spruces killed by I. typographus was determined in a total of 53 stands. In five of the stands all wind-thrown trees were left (unmanaged stands) and in 48 of the stands, which were situated at distances of 1.4–10.0 km from each focal unmanaged stand, the wind-felled trees were removed directly after the storm (managed stands). In the winter preceding the fifth summer new storm-fellings occurred in the study area.3 In the 4-year period between the first and second storm-fellings, 50–322 standing trees were killed by I. typographus per unmanaged stand. There was a direct linear relationship between the number of storm-felled spruces colonized by I. typographus and the number of trees subsequently killed in the unmanaged stands.4 Tree mortality caused by I. typographus in the unmanaged stands was almost nil in the first year, peaked in the second or third year, and decreased markedly to a low level in the fourth and fifth years.5 In the 4-year period between the first and second storm-fellings twice as many trees were killed per ha in the unmanaged stands than in the managed stands: the average difference being 6.2 killed trees per ha, equivalent to 19{\%} of the number of spruce trees felled by the first storm in the unmanaged stands.6 Much higher numbers of trees were killed per ha in the stand edges than in the interiors of both the unmanaged and the managed stands.},

abstract = {Europe's forests offer a plethora of ecosystem services to society, e.g., timber, recreation, biodiversity and carbon storage. Sustainable forest management and conservation measures are applied to ensure the lasting delivery of these services. Forests and forest management, however, face a variety of challenges due to ecological and socio-economic developments, such as climate change and an increasing demand for wood from the bioenergy sector. Albeit these challenges affect forests all over Europe, no common forest policy exists on the EU level to date. Instead, forest and forestry issues are addressed by several EU policies in the environmental, agricultural and energy fields. The “EU Forestry Strategy” (1998) and the “EU Forest Action Plan” (2006), both of which follow a voluntary approach, aim to improve the coordination of those policies by proposing forest related actions to be carried out by the Commission and by Member States. These instruments do not, however, provide a coherent and binding policy framework. Against this backdrop, this study examines in detail which environmental challenges may necessitate a Community approach to protect European forests from harmful impacts and develops options for a common EU approach on forest protection. The study is divided into 2 parts. The first part provides an overview of the current state of European forests as well as relevant threats and challenges regarding European forestry and forest protection. It further discusses existing forest and forest-related policies across the EU. Based on both analyses, need for action is identified. The second part aims to develop and evaluate policy concepts to respond to these needs. Eventually, scenarios for an effective and feasible approach towards better forest protection on the EU level and recommendations for the implementation are provided.},

abstract = {The Argentine Pampas, one of the main agricultural areas in the world, recently has undergone significant changes in land use and structural characteristics of agricultural production systems. Concerns about the environmental and societal impacts of the changes motivated development of an agent-based model (ABM) to gain insight on processes underlying recent observed patterns. The model is described following a standard protocol (ODD). Results are discussed for an initial set of simplified simulations performed to understand the processes that generated and magnified the changes in the Pampas. Changes in the structure of agricultural production and land tenure seem to be driven by differences among farmers' ability to generate sufficient agricultural income to remain in business. In turn, as no off-farm or credit is modeled, economic sustainability is tied to initial resource endowment (area cropped). Farmers operating small areas are economically unviable and must lease out their farms to farmers operating larger areas. This leads to two patterns: (a) a concentration of production (fewer farmers operating larger areas) and, (b) an increase in the area operated by tenants. The simulations showed an increase of soybean area, linked to the higher profitability of this crop. Despite the stylized nature of initial simulations, all emerging patterns are highly consistent with changes observed in the Pampas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper aims at reviewing the ecological effects of windthrow and the processes by which the structure and composition of the boreal forest are affected. The windthrow problem has been investigated at different levels: Landscape; forest community; and fallen tree ecosystem. All original data are from the natural, protected, uneven-aged boreal spruce forests of the central Russian Plain. Mapping of vegetation was used to detect windthrow processes in primary forest communities. The scales of windthrow gaps in space and time determine the patch structure of the forest ecosystems. The main result of this phenomenon is the occurrence of gap-phase dynamics in forest communities. The development of gaps is very important for the survival of small- and broad-leaved trees in boreal coniferous forests. In the case study of the scales of natural windthrow disturbances it was found that in uneven-aged spruce forests, 7-12{\%} of the surface was covered by pit-and-mound topography. After widespread windthrow, this figure rised to 15-25{\%}. In this context, a procedure for dating windthrow topography was developed, along with methods of diagnosing uprooting disturbances of the soil. Much attention was also paid to the structure and properties of soil where uprooting had occurred. It was found that the microsites which are found in pit-and-mound topography differ pedogenically. Furthermore, the nature and rate of recovery of the background soil profile after uprooting varied a lot, i.e. under the influence of shallow uprooting, the reconstruction of the background soil combination and processes was completed in 100-200 years. Where as in cases of major uprootings, it took more than a 200-300 year cycle. The role of tree uprooting in maintaining stable tree and grass population structures in forest communities was found very important. The spatial distribution of trees was associated with pit-and-mound topography in all types of forests. Furthermore, spruce regenerated better on mounds and fallen trees than on undisturbed surfaces. Multi-aged tree regrowth was therefore being constantly formed in virgin forests. There was also increase in the community floristic richness due to the establishment of certain pioneer species from other communities in microsites disturbed by uprooting. The gene pool of a population was rejuvenated as the plants appeared in these microsites from seeds and spores, while propagation in undisturbed areas was predominantly vegetative. As a result, the structure of forest plant populations was found to be in a stable multi-aged state. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {1. Hosts may evolve defences that make them less susceptible and suitable to herbivores impacting their fitness. Due to climate change-driven range expansion, herbivores are encountering na{\"{i}}ve host populations with increasing frequency.2. Aggressive bark beetles are among the most important agents of disturbance in coniferous forest ecosystems. The presence of bark beetle outbreaks in areas with a historically unsuitable climate, in part a consequence of climate change, provided an opportunity to assess the hypothesis that the mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae has higher reproductive success in lodgepole pine Pinus contorta trees growing in areas that have not previously experienced frequent outbreaks.3. We felled and sampled mountain pine beetle-killed trees from historically climatically suitable and unsuitable areas, i.e. areas with and without a historical probability of frequent outbreaks. Reproductive success was determined from a total of 166 trees from 14 stands.4. Brood productivity was significantly affected by climatic suitability class, such that mean brood production per female increased as historical climatic suitability decreased.5. Synthesis and applications. The current study demonstrates that the mountain pine beetle has higher reproductive success in areas where its host trees have not experienced frequent beetle epidemics, which includes much of the current outbreak area in north central British Columbia. This increased productivity of mountain pine beetle is likely to have been a key reason for the rapid population buildup that resulted in unprecedented host tree mortality over huge areas in western Canada. The outbreak thus provides an example of how climate change-driven range expansion of native forest insects can have potentially disastrous consequences. Since an increased reproductive success is likely to accelerate the progression of outbreaks, it is particularly critical to manage forests for the maintenance of a mosaic of species and age classes at the landscape level in areas where host tree populations are na{\"{i}}ve to eruptive herbivores. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Conifers are long-lived organisms, and part of their success is due to their potent defense mechanisms. This review focuses on bark defenses, a front line against organisms trying to reach the nutrient-rich phloem. A major breach of the bark can lead to tree death, as evidenced by the millions of trees killed every year by specialized bark-invading insects. Different defense strategies have arisen in conifer lineages, but the general strategy is one of overlapping constitutive mechanical and chemical defenses overlaid with the capacity to up-regulate additional defenses. The defense strategy incorporates a graded response from ‘repel', through ‘defend' and ‘kill', to ‘compartmentalize', depending upon the advance of the invading organism. Using a combination of toxic and polymer chemistry, anatomical structures and their placement, and inducible defenses, conifers have evolved bark defense mechanisms that work against a variety of pests. However, these can be overcome by strategies including aggregation pheromones of bark beetles and introduction of virulent phytopathogens. The defense structures and chemicals in conifer bark are reviewed and questions about their coevolution with bark beetles are discussed.},

abstract = {Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) feed and breed in dead or severely weakened host trees. When their population densities are high, some species aggregate on healthy host trees so that their defences may be exhausted and the inner bark successfully colonized, killing the tree in the process. Here we investigate under what conditions participating with unrelated conspecifics in risky mass attacks on living trees is an adaptive strategy, and what this can tell us about bark beetle outbreak dynamics. We find that the outcome of individual host selection may deviate from the ideal free distribution in a way that facilitates the emergence of tree-killing (aggressive) behavior, and that any heritability on traits governing aggressiveness seems likely to exist in a state of flux or cycles consistent with variability observed in natural populations. This may have implications for how economically and ecologically important species respond to environmental changes in climate and landscape (forest) structure. The population dynamics emerging from individual behavior are complex, capable of switching between "endemic" and "epidemic" regimes spontaneously or following changes in host availability or resistance. Model predictions are compared to empirical observations, and we identify some factors determining the occurrence and self-limitation of epidemics.},

abstract = {Bark beetles are notorious pests of natural and planted forests causing extensive damage. These insects depend on dead or weakened trees but can switch to healthy trees during an outbreak as mass-attacks allow the beetle to overwhelm tree defences. Climatic events like windstorms are known to favour bark beetle outbreaks because they create a large number of breeding sites, i.e., weakened trees and for this reason, windthrown timber is generally preventively harvested and removed. In December 1999, the southwest of France was struck by a devastatingwindstormthat felledmore that 27 millionm3of timber. This event offered the opportunity to study large-scale spatial pattern of trees attacked by the bark beetle Ips sexdentatusandits relationshipwiththespatial locationof pine logs thatweretemporally storedinpiles alongstandedges during thepost-stormprocessof fallentreeremoval.Thestudywasundertakenina pure maritimepine forestof1300 hain2001and2002.Wedevelopeda landscapeapproachbasedonaGISanda complete inventory of attacked trees. During this study more than 70{\%} of the investigated stands had at least one tree attacked by I. sexdentatus. Spatial aggregation prevailed in stands with n15 attacked trees.

Attacked trees formed patches of 500–700m2 on average which displayed a clumped spatial distribution. Log piles stemming from the sanitation removals were mainly distributed along the large access roadsandshowedanaggregated spatial pattern as well. Thespatial relationship betweenpatches of attacked trees and log pile storage areas was analyzed by means of the Ripley's statistic that revealed a strong association at the scale of the studied forest. Our results indicated that bark beetle attacks were facilitated in the vicinity of areas where pine logs were stored. The spatial extent of this relationship was {\textgreater}1000m. Similar results were obtained in 2001 and 2002 despite differences in the number and spatial distribution of attacked trees. The presence of a strong ‘‘facilitation effect'' suggests that log piles should be removed quickly in order to prevent outbreaks of bark beetles.},

abstract = {1 We analysed time series of spruce bark beetles (N-t) caught in pheromone traps from 1979 to 2000 in approximately 100 localities throughout south-east Norway. 2 The analysis was performed at two spatial scales (whole area and 12 sub-regions), and included additional analyses of the time-series sequences before and after a large windfelling (1987) that appeared to induce a shift in the dynamics. 3 Regression of R-t (logarithmic per-capita growth rate) on Nt-d indicated that the endogenous dynamics were dominated by lag 1 density dependence. This was particularly so in the sequence after the large windfelling (R-2 = 0.79), probably due to intraspecific competition for breeding substrate. 4 The sequence before the windfelling (1979-1987) was declining without significant density dependence. We suggest this to be a transition period, reflecting a drop in carrying capacity due to depletion of susceptible trees during the preceding outbreak period (1970s) and a drop in beetle number to below the density required to kill trees. 5 Windfelling (Wt-l) appears to be an important predictor of the dynamics; however, it was difficult to evaluate the statistical significance of this factor due to only one large windfall event. 6 The weak influence of drought stress (Dt-l) could be due to the absence of severe drought periods within the time series},

@article{Logan1998,
abstract = {The mountain pine beetle [MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Scolytidae)] is an aggressive bark beetle, one that typically needs to kill host trees in order to successfully reproduce. This ecological adaptation has resulted in an organism that is both economically important and ecologically significant. Even though significant resources have been expended on MPB research, and a great deal of knowledge exists regarding individual aspects of MPB ecology, some of the most basic questions regarding outbreaks remain unanswered. In our opinion, one reason for the lack of synthesis and predictive power is the inadequate treatment of spatial dynamics in outbreak theories. This paper explicitly addresses the role of spatial dynamics in the precipitation and propagation of MPB outbreaks. We first describe a spatially dynamic model of the MPB/forest interaction that includes chemical ecology, spatial redistribution of beetles, attack, and resulting host mortality. The model is a system of 6 coupled, partial differential equations with 7 state variables and 20 parameters. It represents an attempt to capture the relatively complex predator/prey interaction between MPB and host trees by including the minimum phenomenological descriptions necessary for ecological credibility. This system of equations describes the temporal dynamics of: beetle attraction as a function of pheromone concentration; the change in numbers of flying and nesting beetles; tree resistance/susceptibility; and tree recovery from attack. Spatial dynamics are modeled by fluxes due to gradients in pheromones and kairomones, and the random redistribution of beetles in absence of semiochemicals. We then use the parameterized model to explore three issues central to the ecology of MPB/forest interaction. The first of these is in response to the need for objective ways to compare patterns of successful beetle attacks as they evolve in space. Simulation results indicate that at endemic levels, the pattern of successful attacks are determined almost exclusively by the underlying distribution of susceptible host trees (environmental determinism). As an outbreak develops, the pattern of successfully attacked trees switches to one that is dynamically driven by the self-generated semiochemical landscape (dynamic determinism). This switch from an environmentally determined spatial pattern to a dynamically driven pattern is the hallmark of an outbreak. We discuss the application of a spatial correlation coefficient that can be used to differentiate between the spatial distribution of killed trees in endemic and outbreak phases. The second issue we address through simulation is synchrony in adult emergence. Synchronous adult emergence is critical for the mass attack strategy necessary for overcoming tree defenses. Results from these simulations indicate that the degree of synchrony in adult emergence can have important consequences for assessing the risk of an outbreak. The final issue we investigate through simulation is the effect of spatial pattern of nurse trees (those successfully attacked the previous year) on outbreak potential. Simulations indicated that the spatial proximity of nurse trees was an important determinant of subsequent successful attacks. We conclude with a discussion of the general implications of our simulation experiments. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The old-growth forest remnants of Western Carpathians provide a unique possibility to study the disturbance regimes of forest ecosystems without human influence. This study investigated the gap dynamics in beech-dominated old-growth forest Badinsky prales in Central Slovakia. Considering the decline of silver fir in last decades, the study analyzed the main characteristics of disturbance regime with the emphasis on the role of fir. On a 5-ha research plot, the dominant tree species was beech, the proportion of fir reached about 10{\%}. However, a significantly higher proportion of fir 30{\%}) was observed in the coarse woody debris. In total, 45 canopy openings were recorded. Canopy gaps and expanded gaps covered 11.3 and 37.9{\%} of the forest area, respectively. Despite the highest frequency of small gaps {\textless} 100 m(2), their proportion of the overall gap area reached only 20{\%}, what suggests the important role of intermediate and large gaps in the gap dynamics as well. The analysis of gapmakers' crown projections confirmed a rather low contribution of fir (14.6{\%}) to the gap formation despite its relatively intensive mortality. A high variability of the next generation age between the gaps (6-44 years) was recorded what suggests a large temporal variation of the disturbance events. The lateral expansion of adjacent trees was found to be the determining process for the closure of small canopy openings. The intermediate and large gaps are more likely closed by the height growth of natural regeneration and understory trees that are present on the majority of the area.},

The objective of this study is to develop a model that integrates the concept of fuzzy set theory with remote sensing and GIS in order to produce susceptibility maps of insect infestations in forest landscapes. Fuzzy set theory was applied to information extracted from multiple‐year high resolution remote sensing data and integrated in a raster‐based GIS to create a map indicating the spatial variation of insect susceptibility in a landscape. Variable‐specific fuzzy membership functions were developed based on expert knowledge and existing data, and integrated through a semantic import model. The results from a case study on mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) illustrate that the model provides a method to successfully estimate areas of varying susceptibility to insect infestation from high resolution remote sensing images. It was concluded that fuzzy sets are an adequate method for dealing with uncertainty in defining susceptibility variables. The susceptibility maps can be utilized for guiding management decisions based on the spatial aspects of insect–host relationships.},

As such, the spatio-temporal nature of decision-making should be acknowledged and incorporated into models developed to assist the management of natural resources. The objective of this research is to develop an Intelligent Agent Model that is able to learn through repetitive simulation how to make decisions regarding natural resource extraction. Specifically, an agent is guided by heuristic algorithms to search a natural landscape and learn which locations hold the highest profits and when it is best to extract the resource in order to improve the potential of future opportunities. The model is implemented using hypothetical and real data sets to emulate the process of harvesting trees in natural forests in order to maximize profits while respecting spatial constraints that are imposed in order to conserve various aspects of the forest. Simulation results reveal the ability of the Intelligent Agent Model to utilize spatio-temporal knowledge in order learn how to devise optimal solutions in a variety of scenarios. Furthermore, the model demonstrates how the timing of decisions is linked to the spatial constraints imposed on the operation. The findings from this research can be used to inform natural resource management about the importance of the relationship between the location and timing of resource-based activities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Forest ecosystem dynamics emerges from nonlinear interactions between adaptive biotic agents (i.e., individual trees) and their relationship with a spatially and temporally heterogeneous abiotic environment. Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes and dynamic interactions across scales. Our specific objectives were (i) to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use, and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands ability to simulate tree growth and mortality for a wide range of forest ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological field theory, iLand calculates a continuous field of light availability over the landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived, size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at stand-level by means of a light-use efficiency approach, and downscaled to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results against independently observed productivity estimates (63.4{\%} of variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged stands. This transect experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The present study aimed to determine which gap and landscape characteristics are correlated with the probability of colonization of wind-felled Norway spruce trees by I. typographus. The study included 36 storm gaps, varying in size from three to 1168 wind-felled spruces, created by the storm Gudrun in southern Sweden in January 2005. In the first summer, on average, 5{\%} of the wind-felled spruces were colonized by I. typographus. The percentage of colonized wind-felled trees per gap was negatively correlated with the total area of storm gaps within 2000 m in the surrounding forest landscape. In the second summer, the proportion of colonized trees increased to 50{\%}. Both gap (mean diameter of wind-felled trees and basal area of living spruce trees) and landscape variables (amount of spruce forest) were significantly correlated with colonization percentage and explained almost 50{\%} of the variation between gaps. There was no relationship between gap area and colonization percentage. This implies that landscapes with many large storm gaps, where logging resources will be most effectively used, should be salvaged first.},

abstract = {Secondary Norway spruce forests in the Western Beskids are among the most damaged forests in Europe. Although spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) has been recently causing large-scale damage to these forests, our understanding of I. typographus dynamics in this environment is inadequate for evaluating forest sustainability. This study aims to evaluate the patterns of damage caused by I. typographus to spruce forests with compromised ecological stability.  Forest infestation by I. typographus was inferred from sanitary felling data collected from 1998 to 2004. Stand and site data were obtained from forest management plans. Spatial-dependence analysis, ordinary kriging and neural network-based regression modelling were used to investigate the patterns of infestation and the casual relationships in the studied ecosystem. I. typographus long-distance dispersal substantially decreased with outbreak culmination. The spread of infestation was only weakly related to stand and site parameters. Infestations spread isotropically at the stand and patch level but directionally at the regional scale. The large-scale spread of infestation can be explained by the uniform age and species composition of the investigated forests and by the ability of populations to overwhelm suboptimal trees. The observations presented here suggest that secondary spruce forests in Europe may be unsustainable due to unprecedented bark beetle outbreaks, which can be further amplified by changing climate.},

abstract = {Forest insect disturbances have an ecological impact and are the cause of partial or complete stands mortality; hence they influence the forest cover change. The modeling of ecological processes such as insect disturbance is challenging due to the complexity of insect outbreaks in forest ecological systems, thus diverse spatial scales need to be considered in order to effectively represent these dynamic spatial phenomena. The objective of the study is to develop a hybrid model that combines swarm intelligence (SI), agent-based modeling (ABM) and cellular automata (CA) with geographic information systems (GIS) for simulating tree mortality patterns introduced by insect infestations at a landscape spatial scale. The focus is on lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta, tree mortality patterns caused by infestations of mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins. The complexity of the insects' behavior during forest disturbances can be captured and simulated by an intelligent ABM. Agents represent insects that have the ability to behave and adapt according to their interactions within the forest environment at a very fine spatial scale at tree-level, and with the use of swarming intelligence approach. However, due to computational complexity such model is not operational at landscape and regional spatial scales where the consequences of infestation phenomenon are most obvious. Therefore, the integration of the ABM with CA approach is proposed to handle modeling at both fine and large spatial scales. The discrete nature of CA enables integration with raster-based geospatial datasets in GIS, and can also be beneficial when modeling complex ecological processes that evolve over time. The developed model includes factors such as wind directions and elevation to demonstrate their influence in the spread patterns of the outbreaks at a landscape spatial scale. The model outcomes provide "what if" scenarios that can assist studying and controlling MPB forest disturbance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In the current context of shady and CWD-deprived managed forests, windthrow gaps act as regional biodiversity hotspots by maintaining habitat continuity in a mosaic landscape, and by facilitating the breeding and population growth of clearing specialists and saproxylic species. Windthrow gaps are dead-wood islands where forest protection and habitat conservation goals may stand against each other. Besides the quantitative effect of dead wood on bark beetle outbreaks and saproxylic diversity, the latter is favoured by key dead-wood micro-habitats such as large logs, snags and sun-exposed coarse woody debris. The role of natural enemies and sanitation operations in regulating pest outbreaks is discussed. Heterogeneous openings provide many micro-habitats favouring flower-visiting insects, phytophages on saplings, on fallen tree crowns, and on diverse understory flora, as well as ground insects on specific micro-sites. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. We examine the relationship between immigration rate and patch area for different types of movement behaviours and detection modes. Theoretical models suggest that the scale dependence of the immigration rate per unit area (I/A) can be described by a power model I/A = i*Area(zeta), where zeta describes the strength of the scale dependence. 2. Three types of scaling were identified. Area scaling (zeta = 0) is expected for passively dispersed organisms that have the same probability of landing anywhere in the patch. Perimeter scaling (-0.30 {\textgreater} zeta {\textgreater} -0.45) is expected when patches are detected from a very short distance and immigrants arrive over the patch boundary, whereas diameter scaling (zeta = -0.5) is expected if patches are detected from a long distance or if search is approximately linear. 3. A meta-analysis of published empirical studies of the scale dependence of immigration rates in terrestrial insects suggests that butterflies show diameter scaling, aphids show area scaling, and the scaling of beetle immigration is highly variable. We conclude that the scaling of immigration rates in many cases can be predicted from search behaviour and the mode of patch detection.},

abstract = {The increasing use of computer simulation modelling brings with it epistemological questions about the possibilities and limits of its use for understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of social and environmental systems. These questions include how we learn from simulation models and how we most appropriately explain what we have learnt. Generative simulation modelling provides a framework to investigate how the interactions of individual heterogeneous entities across space and through time produce system-level patterns. This modelling approach includes individual- and agent-based models and is increasingly being applied to study environmental and social systems, and their interactions with one another. Much of the formally presented analysis and interpretation of this type of simulation resorts to statistical summaries of aggregated, system-level patterns. Here, we argue that generative simulation modelling can be recognised as being 'event-driven', retaining a history in the patterns produced via simulated events and interactions. Consequently, we explore how a narrative approach might use this simulated history to better explain how patterns are produced as a result of model structure, and we provide an example of this approach using variations of a simulation model of breeding synchrony in bird colonies. This example illustrates not only why observed patterns are produced in this particular case, but also how generative simulation models function more generally. Aggregated summaries of emergent system-level patterns will remain an important component of modellers' toolkits, but narratives can act as an intermediary between formal descriptions of model structure and these summaries. Using a narrative approach should help generative simulation modellers to better communicate the process by which they learn so that their activities and results can be more widely interpreted. In turn, this will allow non-modellers to foster a fuller appreciation of the function and benefits of generative simulation modelling. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Forest insect outbreaks can impose significant tree mortality across vast forested landscapes. The current epidemic of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, for example, has led to the mortality of pine trees in western Canada and the U.S. spanning tens of millions of hectares. The ecological processes driving mountain pine beetle outbreaks are governed by multiple feedback mechanisms, thresholds, and external constraints that exist along a spatial continuum from individual insect-tree interactions to landscape level change. These components of mountain pine beetle epidemics need to be explicitly parameterized in modeling efforts that aim to predict where insect disturbance will occur in a forest each year and the amount of tree mortality that will ensue as a result. However, do date, minimal efforts exist that examine how local level interactions between beetles and trees translate into broader patterns of tree mortality, and those that do are limited to relatively local scales. In this study, we present an agent-based model that simulates how tree mortality results from the combination of beetle-tree interactions, beetle-to-beetle communication, tree defense to beetle attack, beetle density dynamics, host tree availability, dispersal behavior, and landscape heterogeneity. Our model is tested using data from an area in central British Columbia, Canada, that is near the center of the current outbreak in that region. The model simulates both overall tree mortality and spatial patterns of tree mortality, producing results that are similar to those observed in aerial surveys of tree health. Moving forward, the computational efficiency of our model demonstrates the capability to be applied to large, regional landscapes when implemented with sufficient computing resources. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

We present a conceptual framework using one system as a model, emphasizing interactions across levels of biological hierarchy and spatiotemporal scales. Bark beetles are major natural disturbance agents in western North American forests. However, recent bark beetle population eruptions have exceeded the frequencies, impacts, and ranges documented during the previous 125 years. Extensive host abundance and susceptibility, concentrated beetle density, favorable weather, optimal symbiotic associations, and escape from natural enemies must occur jointly for beetles to surpass a series of thresholds. and exert widespread disturbance. Opposing feedbacks determine qualitatively distinct outcomes at junctures at the biochemical through landscape levels. Eruptions occur when key thresholds are surpassed, prior constraints cease to exert influence, and positive feedbacks amplify across scales. These dynamics are bidirectional, as landscape features influence how lower-scale processes are amplified or buffered. Climate change and reduced habitat heterogeneity increase the likelihood that key thresholds will be exceeded, and may cause fundamental regime shifts. Systems in which endogenous feedbacks can dominate after external forces foster the initial breach of thresholds appear particularly sensitive to anthropogenic perturbations.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of protected areas can diminish during times of pronounced socio-economic and institutional change. Our goals were to assess the effectiveness of Romanian protected areas at stemming unsanctioned logging, and to assess post-socialist logging in their surrounding landscapes, during a time of massive socio-economic and institutional change. Our results suggest that forest cover remained fairly stable shortly before and after 1990, but forest disturbance rates increased sharply in two waves after 1995 and 2005. We found substantial disturbances inside protected areas, even within core reserve areas. Moreover, disturbances in the matrix surrounding protected areas were even lower than inside protected area boundaries. We suggest that these rates are largely the result of high logging rates, triggered by rapid ownership and institutional changes. These trends compromise the goals of Romania's protected area network, lead to an increasing loss of forest habitat, and more isolated and more fragmented protected areas. The effectiveness of Romania's protected area network in terms of its ability to safeguard biodiversity is therefore most likely decreasing.},

abstract = {Landscapes are the resultant of ecological processes and events operating on many different space-time scales. Large scale disturbance is recognized as a major influence on landscape patterns, but the impact of small scale events is often overlooked. We develop an hierarchical framework to relate lightning and bark beetle population dynamics to the southern pine forest landscape using the concepts of disturbance propagation and amplification. The low level lightning disturbance can be propagated to the landscape level when weather and forest stand structure facilitate bark beetle epidemics. We identify epidemics as biotically-driven episodes that alter landscape structure. The concept of the landscape as the spatial dimension of these episodes is represented in a conceptual model linking insect-host and landscape mosaic interactions.},

abstract = {Conventional supervised classification of satellite images uses a single multi-band image and coincident ground observations to construct spectral signatures of land cover classes. We compared this approach with three alternatives that derive signatures from multiple images and time periods: (1) signature generalization: spectral signatures are derived from multiple images within one season, but perhaps from different years; (2) signature expansion: spectral signatures are created with data from images acquired during different seasons of the same year; and (3) combinations of expansion and generalization. Using data for northern Laos, we assessed the quality of these different signatures to (a) classify the images used to derive the signature, and (b) for use in temporal signature extension, i.e., applying a signature obtained from data of one or several years to images from other years. When applying signatures to the images they were derived from, signature expansion improved accuracy relative to the conventional method, and variability in accuracy declined markedly. In contrast, signature generalization did not improve classification. When applying signatures to images of other years (temporal extension), the conventional method, using a signature derived from a single image, resulted in very low classification accuracy. Signature expansion also performed poorly but multi-year signature generalization performed much better and this appears to be a promising approach in the temporal extension of spectral signatures for satellite image classification.},

abstract = {Disturbances are key processes in the carbon cycle of forests and other ecosystems. In recent decades, mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks have become more frequent and extensive in western North America. Remote sensing has the ability to fill the data gaps of long-term infestation monitoring, but the elimination of observational noise and attributing changes quantitatively are two main challenges in its effective application. Here, we present a forest growth trend analysis method that integrates Landsat temporal trajectories and decision tree techniques to derive annual forest disturbance maps over an 11-year period. The temporal trajectory component successfully captures the disturbance events as represented by spectral segments, whereas decision tree modeling efficiently recognizes and attributes events based upon the characteristics of the segments. Validated against a point set sampled across a gradient of MPB mortality, 86.74{\%} to 94.00{\%} overall accuracy was achieved with small variability in accuracy among years. In contrast, the overall accuracies of single-date classifications ranged from 37.20{\%} to 75.20{\%} and only become comparable with our approach when the training sample size was increased at least four-fold. This demonstrates that the advantages of this time series work flow exist in its small training sample size requirement. The easily understandable, interpretable and modifiable characteristics of our approach suggest that it could be applicable to other ecoregions.},

@article{Maas2010,
abstract = {Remote sensing image data from sources such as Landsat or airborne multispectral digital cameras are typically in the form of digital count (DC) values. To compare images acquired by the same sensor system on different dates, or images acquired by different sensor systems, it is necessary to correct for differences in the DC values due to sensor characteristics (gain and offset), illumination of the surface (a function of sun angle), and atmospheric clarity. A method is described for normalizing one image to another, or converting image DC values to surface reflectance. This method is based on the identification of pseudo-invariant features (bare soil line and full canopy point) in the scatter plot of red and near-infrared image pixel values. The method, called “scatter plot matching” (SPM), is demonstrated by normalizing a Landsat-7 ETM+ image to a Landsat-5 TM image, and by converting the pixel DC values in a Landsat-5 TM image to values of surface reflectance. While SPM has some limitations, it represents a simple, 
straight-forward method for calibrating remote sensing image data.},

abstract = {Abstract: After a century of fire exclusion, western US forests are vulnerable to wildfire and bark beetles. Although integrated fire and pest management programs (e.g., prescribed burning and thinning) are being implemented efficiently, damage to forests continues. Management challenges come in the forms of diverse land ownership, dynamic forest landscapes, the uncertainty effect of management strategies, and social interaction of the increasing wildland-urban interface. Three-dimensional (3-D) landscape visualization is comprised of multi-spatial, multi-temporal, and multi-expression elements. Supplemented with GIS database, remote sensing images, and simulation models, this technique can provide a comprehensive communication medium for decision makers, scientists, stakeholders, and the public with diverse backgrounds on the wildfire and forest bark beetle management. The technique we describe here can be used to organize complicated temporal and spatial information, evaluate alternative management operations, and improve decision-making processes. The application and limitations of our technique are also discussed.},

abstract = {Bark beetles, especially Dendroctonus species, are considered to be serious pests of the coniferous forests in North America. Bark beetle forest pests undergo population eruptions, causing regionwide economic losses. In order to save forests, finding new and innovative environmentally friendly approaches in wood-boring insect pest management is more important than ever. Several biological control methods have been attempted over time to limit the damage and spreading of bark beetle epidemics. The use of entomopathogenic microorganisms against bark beetle populations is an attractive alternative tool for many biological control programmes in forestry. However, the effectiveness of these biological control agents is strongly affected by environmental factors, as well as by the susceptibility of the insect host. Bark beetle susceptibility to entomopathogens varies greatly between species. According to recent literature, bark beetles are engaged in symbiotic relationships with fungi and bacteria. These types of relationship are very complex and apparently involved in bark beetle defensive mechanisms against pathogens. The latest scientific discoveries in multipartite symbiosis have unravelled unexpected opportunities in bark beetle pest management, which are discussed in this article.

There was a positive relationship between the catches of I. typographus and (i) the percentage of the surrounding landscape covered by mature spruce forest at radii 500–4000 m and (ii) the percentage of spruce in stands cut when the clear-cuts used as trapping sites were created. For P. chalcographus, only the second relationship could be demonstrated. 4 Thus, for monitoring of I. typographus: (i) several trapping sites per landscape are required; (ii) the amount of mature spruce forest around trapping sites needs to be considered when choosing trapping sites; and (iii) the trapping sites need to be standardized with respect to the percentage of spruce in the cut stand when fresh clear-cuts are used. For P. chalcographus, fewer trapping sites per landscape are required and only the percentage of spruce in the cut stand needs to be considered.},

abstract = {The Eurasian spruce bark beetle Ips typographus and their fungal associates can cause severe damage to Nor- way spruce forests. In this paper, by using both molecular and cultural methods, we compared fungal assemblages on bark beetles from different locations, characterized by different beetle population levels. Ips typographus was trapped in the western Alps in two outbreak and in two control areas. Se- quencing of clone libraries of Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) identified 31 fungal Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), while fungal isolations yielded 55 OTUs. Only three OTUs were detected by both molecular and cultural methods indicating that both methods are necessary to adequately describe fungal richness. Fungal assemblages on insects from these four and from an additional 12 study sites differed among stands in response to varying ecological conditions and to the limited spreading ability of I. typographus. Ophiostomatoid fungi showed higher diversity in outbreak areas; the pathogenic Ophiostoma polonicum was relatively uncommon, while O. bicolor was the most abundant species. This result was not unexpected, as insects were trapped not at the peak but at the end of the outbreaks and supports the hypothesis of a temporal succession among Ophiostoma species. Ubiquitous endophytes of trees or common airborne fungi were present both in outbreak and in control areas. Wood decaying basidiomycetes were almost never detected on beetles. Yeasts were detected only by molecular analysis, and the OTUs detected matched those reported elsewhere in Europe and in the world, suggesting a very long association between some yeasts and bark beetles.},

In forests of central Europe and Scandinavia, the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is the most devastating biotic disturbance agent in Norway spruce Picea abies, but our understanding of the factors determining its spatio-temporal dynamics is still quite limited. To quantify the drivers of bark beetle dynamics, we analyzed a survey dataset with annual resolution that covers 17 yr and 469 forest districts (10 860 km2 of forest area) all over Switzerland. We used Poisson log-normal models in a Bayesian framework to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of bark beetle infestation spots at the forest district level. Bark beetle infestations increased with increasing heat sum ( 8.3°C), volume of standing Norway spruce stock, and the number of infestation spots of the previous year. Precipitation tended to slightly affect the risk of bark beetle infestations. Two major storm events further increased the spatio-temporal variability of bark beetle infestations. Spruce abundance, storm damage and temperature are known to be important factors influencing the population dynamics of the European spruce bark beetle. Our study is the first to quantify the combined effects of spruce abundance and heat sum, whereby the heat sum turned out to be the most important and consistent predictor. Because our study area encompasses large ecological and climatological gradients, our model is likely to be applicable to Norway spruce forests in other regions of central Europe and Scandinavia.},

abstract = {Norway spruce is one of the most important conifer tree species in Europe, paramount for timber pro- vision, habitat, recreation, and protection of mountain roads and settlements from natural hazards. Although natural Norway spruce forests exhibit diverse structures, even-aged stands can arise after disturbance or as the result of common silvicultural practice, including off-site afforestation. Many even-aged Norway spruce forests face issues such as senescence, insufficient regeneration, mechanical stability, sensitivity to biotic disturbances, and restoration. We pro- pose the use of Density Management Diagrams (DMD), stand-scale graphical models designed to project growth and yield of even-aged forests, as a heuristic tool for assessing the structure and development of even-aged Norway spruce stands. DMDs are predicated on basic tree allometry and the assumption that self-thinning occurs predictably in forest stands. We designed a DMD for Nor- way spruce in temperate Europe based on wide-ranging forest inventory data. Quantitative relationships between tree- and stand-level variables that describe resistance to selected natural disturbances were superimposed on the DMD. These susceptibility zones were used to demonstrate assessment and possible management actions related to, for example, windfirmness and effectiveness of the protective function against rockfall or avalanches. The Norway spruce DMD provides forest managers and silviculturists a simple, easy-to-use, tool for evaluating stand dynamics and sched- uling needed density management actions.},

abstract = {Bark beetles and associated fungi are among the greatest natural threats to conifers worldwide. Conifers have potent defenses, but resistance to beetles and fungal pathogens may be reduced if tree stored resources are consumed by fungi rather than used for tree defense. Here, we assessed the relationship between tree stored resources and resistance to Ceratocystis polonica, a phytopathogenic fungus vectored by the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. We measured phloem and sapwood nitrogen, non-structural carbohydrates (NSC), and lipids before and after trees were attacked by I. typographus (vectoring C. polonica) or artificially inoculated with C. polonica alone. Tree resistance was assessed by measuring phloem lesions and the proportion of necrotic phloem around the tree's circumference following attack or inoculation. While initial resource concentrations were unrelated to tree resistance to C. polonica, over time, phloem NSC and sapwood lipids declined in the trees inoculated with C. polonica. Greater resource declines correlated with less resistant trees (trees with larger lesions or more necrotic phloem), suggesting that resource depletion may be caused by fungal consumption rather than tree resistance. Ips typographus may then benefit indirectly from reduced tree defenses caused by fungal resource uptake. Our research on tree stored resources represents a novel way of understanding bark beetle-fungal-conifer interactions.},

The ability to predict ecological responses has often been hampered by our rather limited understanding of trophic interactions. Indeed, it has proven difficult to discern direct and indirect effects of environmental change on animal populations owing to limited information about vegetation at large temporal and spatial scales. The rapidly increasing use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecological studies has recently changed this situation. Here, we review the use of the NDVI in recent ecological studies and outline its possible key role in future research of environmental change in an ecosystem context.},

@article{Macfarlane2013,
abstract = {An innovative aerial survey method called the Landscape Assessment System (LAS) was used to assess mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae)-caused mortality of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) across the species distribution in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE; 894 774 ha). This large-scale implementation of the LAS method consisted of 8673 km of flight lines, along which 4653 geo-tagged, oblique aerial photos were captured at the catchment level (a subset of 12-digit USGS hydrologic units) and geographic information system (GIS) processed. The Mountain Pine Beetle-caused Mortality Rating System, a landscape-scale classification system designed specifically to measure the cumulative effects of recent and older MPB attacks on whitebark pine, was used to classify mortality with a rating from 0 to 6 based on the amount of red (recent attack) and gray (old attack) trees visible. The approach achieved a photo inventory of 79{\%} of the GYE whitebark pine distribution. For the remaining 21{\%}, mortality levels were estimated based on an interpolated surface. Results that combine the photo-inventoried and interpolated mortality indicate that nearly half (46{\%}) of the GYE whitebark pine distribution showed severe mortality (3-4 or 5.3-5.4 rating), 36{\%} showed moderate mortality (2-2.9 rating), 13{\%} showed low mortality (1-1.9 rating), and 5{\%} showed trace levels of mortality (0-0.9). These results reveal that the proliferation of MPB in the subalpine zone of the GYE due to climate warming has led to whitebark pine mortality that is more severe and widespread than indicated from either previous modeling research or USDA Forest Service Aerial Detection surveys. Sixteen of the 22 major mountain ranges of the GYE have experienced widespread moderate-to-severe mortality. The majority of catchments in the other six mountain ranges show low-to-moderate mortality. Refugia from MPB outbreaks, at least for now, also exist and correspond to locations that have colder microclimates. The spatially explicit mortality information produced by this project has helped forest managers develop and implement conservation strategies that include both preservation and restoration efforts. Future research aimed at documenting and quantifying the ecological impacts of widespread decline and collapse of this foundation and keystone species is warranted.},

abstract = {Classification procedures are some of the most widely used statistical methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.},

@article{Schiebe2011,
abstract = {The semiochemical diversity hypothesis (SDH) states that interference with host-selection from non-host volatiles (NHV) is an important mechanism for associational resistance. Inhibition of bark beetle attraction to point sources by non-host volatiles (NHV) is well established and might be a signal serving in host-selection also at the habitat scale. In forests dominated by Norway spruce in middle and northern Europe (N Slovakia 2006 {\&} 2007, SE Sweden 2007), we applied a blend of NHV and verbenone, released from dispensers fixed at 2 and 6m height at forest edges with high Ips typographus populations. In Slovakia, three different doses (0.2-0.7dispensers/m forest edge) were tested in 20-tree zones of spruce stand edges. The Swedish experiments used only the middle dose. In Slovakia, there was high tree mortality but dispensers with the anti-attractants reduced killed trees in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction in tree killing ranged from 35 to 76{\%} compared to untreated zones. Regression analysis of relative tree kill on log dispenser density was highly significant (=0.34, corresponding effect size d 0.98). In Sweden, with lower beetle populations, most attacks (99{\%}) were found outside the experimental areas, with high attack rates (15trees/ha) in a range of 15-30m from treated groups, indicating an active inhibitory radius exceeding the previous estimates. The SDH as a functional aspect of biodiversity was tested by converting spruce monocultures into an artificial semiochemically mixed forests. The use of NHV provides the only non-insecticidal method of direct protection of conifer forests. The demonstrated principle of protection is still too expensive for area-wide use, but viable for high-value areas (nature reserves). Further development of push-pull strategies or area-wide applications may prove more cost efficient. In the long-term, the only sustainable approach is a forest landscape of mixed habitats. 2011 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.},

Sezgin and Sankur (2004) categorize thresholding methods into the following six groups based on the information the algorithm manipulates (Sezgin et al., 2004): Histogram shape-based methods, where, for example, the peaks, valleys and curvatures of the smoothed histogram are analyzedClustering-based methods, where the gray-level samples are clustered in two parts as background and foreground (object), or alternately are modeled as a mixture of two Gaussians 
Entropy (meria neusporiadanost) -based methods result in algorithms that use the entropy of the foreground and background regions, the cross-entropy between the original and binarized image, etc. 
Object Attribute-based methods search a measure of similarity between the gray-level and the binarized images, such as fuzzy shape similarity, edge coincidence, etc. 
Spatial methods [that] use higher-order probability distribution and/or correlation between pixelsLocal methods adapt the threshold value on each pixel to the local image characteristics.porovnaie 6 indexov - ci maju rovnak{\'{e}} v{\'{y}}sledky

abstract = {Biodiversity loss from plant communities is often acknowledged to affect primary production but little is known about effects on herbivores. We conducted a meta-analysis of a worldwide data set of 119 studies to compare herbivory in single-species and mixed forests. This showed a significant reduction of herbivory in more diverse forests but this varied with the host specificity of insects. In diverse forests, herbivory by oligophagous species was virtually always reduced, whereas the response of polyphagous species was variable. Further analyses revealed that the composition of tree mixtures may be more important than species richness per se because diversity effects on herbivory were greater when mixed forests comprised taxonomically more distant tree species, and when the proportion of non-host trees was greater than that of host trees. These findings provide new support for the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning across trophic levels.},

@article{Kausrud2012,
abstract = {In recent decades we have seen rapid and co-occurring changes in landscape structure, species distributions and even climate as consequences of human activity. Such changes affect the dynamics of the interaction between major forest pest species, such as bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), and their host trees. Normally breeding mostly in broken or severely stressed spruce; at high population densities some bark beetle species can colonise and kill healthy trees on scales ranging from single trees in a stand to multi-annual landscape-wide outbreaks. In Eurasia, the largest outbreaks are caused by the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (Linnaeus), which is common and shares a wide distribution with its main host, Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.). A large literature is now available, from which this review aims to synthesize research relevant for the population dynamics of I. typographus and co-occurring species under changing conditions. We find that spruce bark beetle population dynamics tend to be metastable, but that mixed-species and age-heterogeneous forests with good site-matching tend to be less susceptible to large-scale outbreaks. While large accumulations of logs should be removed and/or debarked before the next swarming period, intensive removal of all coarse dead wood may be counterproductive, as it reduces the diversity of predators that in some areas may play a role in keeping I. typographus populations below the outbreak threshold, and sanitary logging frequently causes edge effects and root damage, reducing the resistance of remaining trees. It is very hard to predict the outcome of interspecific interactions due to invading beetle species or I. typographus establishing outside its current range, as they can be of varying sign and strength and may fluctuate depending on environmental factors and population phase. Most research indicates that beetle outbreaks will increase in frequency and magnitude as temperature, wind speed and precipitation variability increases, and that mitigating forestry practices should be adopted as soon as possible considering the time lags involved.},

These handicaps are of use to the selecting sex since they test the quality of the mate. The size of characters selected in this way serve as marks of quality. The understanding that a handicap, which tests for quality, can evolve as a consequence of its advantage to the individual, may provide an explanation evolutionary problems. Such an interpretation may provide an alternative to other hypotheses which assumed complicated selective mechanisms, such as group selection or kin selection, which do not act directly on the individual.},

abstract = {The population of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) in the forest of Rold Skov was monitored in the years following a 1981 gale. All attacked standing trees, areas with windthrown trees, catches in pheromone traps, timing of salvage harvests, and stands exposed to attack were registered and mapped in 1982 and 1983. Three different indices for attack density in areas around windthrown trees. infested trees and pheromone traps were calculated using GIS (ArcView). The attack densities in 1983 around areas with windthrown trees salvaged after 1 July 1982 were significantly higher than for areas salvaged earlier. Attack densities around windthrown trees salvaged between 15 May and 1 July, just after the main spring flight period. were the lowest. The maximum distance from an old attack to a new was 650 m and there was an old attack within 500 m of all new attacks. Attack densities around pheromone traps were not correlated with the number of beetles caught in the traps. The majority of the beetles emerging from an epidemic attack dispersed over short distances (i.e. {\textless} 500 m) before entering a new host. This local dispersal may best be countered by removing old breeding sites/windthrown trees in the period between spring-flight and the emergence of the new generation, i.e. by using the windthrown trees as bait trees. Pheromone traps are not suitable as a sole protective measure to prevent further infestation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The influence of natural disturbance on biodiversity is poorly known in the intensively cultivated landscape of Europe. As an example of insect disturbance we studied effects of gaps generated by outbreaks of the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) on biodiversity in the area of the National Park "Bavarian Forest" and compared them with openings (e.g. meadows) created by humans in these forests. Insects were sampled using flight interception traps across twelve ecotones between edges of closed forest, six bark beetle gaps and six meadows. The diversity and species density of true bugs and of bees/wasps increased significantly from the closed stand to the edge, and continued to increase inside the openings at interior and exterior edges. Species density in saproxylic beetles also increased significantly from closed forest to opening, but only across ecotones including bark beetle gaps. Similarly, the number of critically endangered saproxylic beetles increased significantly in bark beetle gaps. Using indicator species analysis a total of 60 species were identified as possessing a statistically significant value indicating preference for one of the habitat types along the ecotones: 29 of them preferred gaps, 24 preferred meadows, three were characteristic for edges of meadows, three for edges of bark beetle gaps, but only one was typical of closed forest. Most of our results support the thesis that I. typographus fulfils the majority of criteria for a keystone species, particularly that of maintenance of biodiversity in forests. Our results emphasize the value for the study and conservation of insect diversity of the policy of non-interference with natural processes pursued in some protected areas. As a recommendation to forest management for increasing insect diversity even in commercial forest, we suggest that logging in recent gaps in medium aged mixed montane stands should aim at retention of a part of the dead wood. Planting should be avoided, to lengthen the important phase of sunlit conditions.},

@article{Duelli1997,
abstract = {Mark-release-recapture experiments with both newly emerged and flight experienced Ips typographus L. were performed in a pine forest near Prague. Three concentric trap circles around the release site with a radius of 5 m, 200 m and 500 m, and intertrap distances of 6 m, 16 m and, maximally, 40 m, were installed with the intention of collecting all dispersing bark beetles ready to respond to pheromone lures. The results show that even without wind and no potential host trees in the surroundings, only about one-third (35.4{\%}) of the emerging beetles in an infested site can be eliminated locally with phermomone traps. At least 12.2{\%} of the emerging beetles (25.7{\%} of the recaptures), perform an adaptive migration flight, which brings them beyond the range of local pheromone traps. The estimated proportion of emigrants can rise over 50{\%}, if most of the freshly emerged beetles that have never been recaptured are assumed to have left the experimental area. Electroantennograms recorded in the laboratory at different times after emergence indicate that the delayed response to aggregation pheromones in migrating bark beetles is not the result of a delayed maturation of the antennal receptor cells, but obviously governed by the central nervous system. The notion of precopulatory migration in 25-50{\%} of the individuals in an I. typographus population can explain why pheromone traps can never eliminate all emerging beetles, and why so many bark beetles can be collected far away from any breeding sites.},

abstract = {Ips typographus populations were analysed by enzyme electrophoresis and by sequence analysis in order to quantify the degree of population differentiation. Enzyme electrophoresis showed a high gene flow among all European populations. Analysis of single loci showed that aspartate aminotransferase-2 (Aat-2) clustered the Scandinavian populations apart from the other populations whereas other enzyme loci showed no significant pattern. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed eight haplotypes. The populations from Italy, Croatia and Belgium were the most polymorphic. Two haplotypes (I and II) were found in the majority of Central European populations. In the northern populations only one haplotype (I) was found. The Russian and Lithuanian populations had a particular haplotype (IV) that was not found in any of the other populations. In view of these data it is suggested that the population structure of I. typographus has been influenced by events which took place during and after the last ice age. Populations were forced into refugial areas in the south and in the area north of Moscow along with the host tree, Picea abies. P. abies had four refugial areas: the Apennine Alps, the Dinaric Alps, the Carpathian Alps and Kostroma, an area north of Moscow. With amelioration of the temperature, beetles spread after P. abies. According to the data presented here, I. typographus migrated from the Apennine and/or Dinaric Alps to the north. Whilst there is evidence for high gene flow among populations, bottleneck effects can still be detected in the north and also in the east. Beetles from the refugial area north of Moscow did not spread to Scandinavia or to the west like the host tree.},

abstract = {Ips typographus (Col., Curculionidae, Scolytinae) occurring on Picea abies stems is a species characterised by large fluctuations in population numbers and causing frequent outbreaks. In protected areas, I. typographus is regarded as a sensitive bioindicator responsive to changes in forest health and vitality. In conservation-oriented forestry, attention is being paid to the ecological value of I. typographus beetles as ecosystem engineers and keystone species, driving forest natural regeneration and conversion. Despite many publications devoted to I. typographus, no accurate method for estimating the population density of this species has been developed. The objective of this study was to develop a statistical method for estimating I. typographus population density that enables calculation of estimation errors. The proposed method consists of two parts: tree-level analyses and stand-level analyses. Part one allows calculation of the total density of I. typographus infestation of each of P. abies selected stem (after selecting sample windfalls), part two allows estimation of the mean total infestation density of the stem in the area investigated. Linear regression functions were applied to part one and survey sampling to part two. The method is only marginally invasive because it involves debarking of one 0.5m-long stem section on maximum 50 P. abies windfalls (trap trees can optionally be used). The developed method was employed to assess I. typographus population density in the {\'{S}}wieogonektokrzyskie Mountains in Central Poland in an area of ca. 4,000ha. In 2010, in the area investigated, the mean total I. typographus infestation density of the P. abies stem was 440.6 maternal galleries/m2 (from 358.7 to 522.6 maternal galleries/m2 with $\alpha$=0.05; the relative error of estimation was 18.6{\%}). The examined I. typographus population was in a progradation phase. The proposed method can be used in nature reserves, national parks and managed forests, mainly for scientific purposes. 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Head-space samples of Ips typographus dead beetles taken from pheromone traps were tested by combined gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GCEAD)on the antennae of the same species, and identiﬁed by GC-mass spectroscopy (MS). The GC-EAD analysis showed that antennae of both sexes responded to 1-hexanol and verbenone from the aeration samples,while the typical and strong carrion odours from the dead beetles such as dimethyld isulphide,3-methyl-1-butenol (isoamylalcohol),2,5-dimethyl pyrazinean disovaleric acid elicited no antennal responses. The EAD active compounds,1-hexanol and verbenone, have been shown in earlier studies to be inhibitory on attraction of I. typographus to pheromone traps. Thus, the decreased catching efficacy of pheromone traps with many dead beetles might be the result of the release of 1-hexanol and verbenone from the dead beetles, but not to the typical carrion smells which are strongly detected by the human nose.},

abstract = {Windstorms cause major disturbances in European forests. Forest management can play a key role in making forests more persistent to disturbances. However, better information is needed to support decision making that effectively accounts for wind disturbances. Here we show how empirical probability models of wind damage, combined with existing spatial data sets, can be used to provide fine-scale spatial information about disturbance probability over large areas. First, we created stand-level damage probability models using wind damage observations within 5-year time window in national forest inventory data (NFI). Model predictors described forest characteristics, forest management history, 10-year return-rate of maximum wind speed, and soil, site and climate conditions. We tested three different methods for creating the damage probability models – generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM) and boosted regression trees (BRT). Then, damage probability maps were calculated by combining the models with GIS data sets representing the model predictors. Finally, we demonstrated the predictive performance of the damage probability maps with a large, independent test data of over 33,000 NFI plots, which shows that the maps are able to identify vulnerable forests also in new wind damage events, with area under curve value (AUC) {\textgreater} 0.7. Use of the more complex methods (GAM and BRT) was not found to improve the performance of the map compared to GLM, and therefore we prefer using the simpler GLM method that can be more easily interpreted. The map allows identification of vulnerable forest areas in high spatial resolution (16 m × 16 m), making it useful in assessing the vulnerability of individual forest stands when making management decisions. The map is also a powerful tool for communicating disturbance risks to forest owners and managers and it has the potential to steer forest management practices to a more disturbance-aware direction. Our study showed that in spite of the inherent stochasticity of the wind and damage phenomena at all spatial scales, it can be modelled with good accuracy across large spatial scales when existing ground and earth observation data sources are combined smartly. With improving data quality and availability, map-based risk assessments can be extended to other regions and other disturbance types.},

abstract = {Forests play a crucial role in the transition towards a bioeconomy by providing biomass to substitute for fossil-based materials and energy. However, a policy-policy conflict exists between the desire to increase the utilization of bio based renewable resources and the desire to protect and conserve biodiversity. Increasing forest harvest levels to meet the needs of the bioeconomy may conflict with biodiversity protection and ecosystem services provided by forests. Through an optimization framework, we examined trade-offs between increasing the extraction of timber resources, and the impacts on biodiversity and non-wood ecosystem services, and investigated possibilities to reconcile trade-off with changes in forest management in 17 landscapes in boreal forests. A diverse range of alternative forest management regimes were used. The alternatives varied from set aside to continuous cover forestry and a range of management options to reflect potential applications of the current management recommendations. These included adjustments to the number of thinning, the timing of final felling and the method of regeneration. Increasing forest harvest level to the maximum economically sustainable harvest had a negative effect on the habitat suitability index, bilberry yield, deadwood diversity and carbon storage. It resulted in a loss in variation among landscapes in their conservation capacity and the ability to provide ecosystem services. Multi-objective optimization results showed that combining different forest management regimes alleviated the negative effects of increasing harvest levels to biodiversity and non-wood ecosystem services. The results indicate that careful landscape level forest management planning is crucial to minimize the ecological costs of increasing harvest levels.},

abstract = {Understanding of how a large landscape or network of conservation areas and habitats of red-listed species change in time is an important topic when addressing the temporal interplay between protected areas and matrix. We developed models of habitat suitability indices (HSI) for saproxylic red-listed invertebrate and fungal species, accounting for roughly 70{\%} of all red-listed boreal forest species of the study area in eastern Finland. By using a forestry planning program that incorporates various optimisation methods we analysed trade-offs between timber production and amount of habitats of saproxylic red-listed species within a 60-year period. We also produced production possibility frontiers that show how to increase quality of the matrix with least costs. Moreover, we analysed how habitat suitability criteria used in optimisations affect the area of different habitat quality classes. Our analysis shows that by adopting HSI models in long-term matrix management, it is possible to increase habitats for several red-listed species without substantial losses in timber production. The increase in habitat area is achieved mainly by decreasing the area that is thinned compared to intensive timber production plan. In the long term, this seems to be a novel cost-effective method to increase the quality of the matrix for red-listed saproxylic species. However, the selected optimisation method and the criteria or specification of the management objective for red-listed forest species have a strong effect on results when HSI models are used in conservation planning. Therefore any practical application must be performed with great care. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Outbreaks of the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus kill extensive areas of Norway spruce forests in Central Europe, affecting both protected areas and neighboring commercial forests. In protected areas, uncontrolled (non-intervention) management allows natural beetle-induced tree mortality, while in commercial forests infested trees are salvage-logged in order to lower I. typographus numbers and stabilize wood production. However, the effects of active pest controls on I. typographus population are often ambiguous, and little is known about how antagonists, beetle density, or intraspecific competition help terminate I. typographus outbreaks. To answer this question, we studied I. typographus population development, breeding performance, and natural antagonists under intervention and non-intervention management in the High Tatra Mts. from 2014 to 2017. We used sentinel logs and windthrown trees, following the current legislation in Tatransk{\'{y}} n{\'{a}}rodn{\'{y}} park (TANAP, Slovakia) and Tatrza{\'{n}}ski Park Narodowy (TPN, Poland). Both parks are mountainous, are covered by Norway spruce forests that have been extensively affected by windthrows and extensive I. typographus outbreaks over the last 20 years, and are zoned under intervention and non-intervention types of management. We found that I. typographus was a dominant species and that its numbers gradually increased during the study, but that the numbers of maternal galleries in sentinel logs (from 50 to 300 per m2) and sex ratio (1 male:2.5 females) remained the same among years. The length of maternal galleries and egg production (per m2 of bark), however, gradually declined, and breeding performance decreased from 10 daughter beetles per female in 2014 to almost zero in 2017. These parameters did not significantly differ between intervention and non-intervention sites. Antagonists were not abundant and had limited effects on I. typographus numbers. Active intervention did not affect I. typographus population dynamics or rates of parasitism but increased numbers of Thanasimus beetles, which are predators of bark beetles. In other words, intervention increased the numbers of some natural enemies of I. typographus but did not affect I. typographus population dynamics. Because control measures did not reduce I. typographus numbers in the intervention zone, the natural ecological processes crucial for maintaining ecosystem functioning and biodiversity were evidently preserved.},

These approaches continue to evolve, and in the last 5 years, the research has expanded to demonstrate how complex, non-linear relationships can be recognised and incorporated into planning processes at the tree, stand, forest and landscape levels. In addition to an overview of the use of optimisation in forestry, we provide an examination of work published in the last 5 years from 30 international journals, worldwide, which consistently publish forestry and natural resource management research papers. Through this review, we found that landscape-level optimisa-tion is a relatively new and expanding area of research, most often performed by one large public landowner in regions where the resulting plan of action has an effect on all landowners and resources. We also note that at the forest level, exact methods for optimising systems mainly continue to be used, and at the stand level, optimisation seems to now involve exploration of a variety of analytical methods. A large portion of the recent research in the optimisation of forest management have involved European forests, which is a function of large public ownership of land and the tradition and requirements for management planning, and roughly half of the effort has arisen from researchers located in Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden).},

abstract = {Remote sensing is a key information source for improving the spatiotemporal understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics. Yet, the mapping and attribution of forest change remains challenging, particularly in areas where a number of interacting disturbance agents simultaneously affect forest development. The forest ecosystems of Central Europe are coupled human and natural systems, with natural and human disturbances affecting forests both individually and in combination. To better understand the complex forest disturbance dynamics in such systems, we utilize 32-year Landsat time series to map forest disturbances in five sites across Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. All sites consisted of a National Park and the surrounding forests, reflecting three management zones of different levels of human influence (managed, protected, strictly protected). This allowed for a comparison of spectral, temporal, and spatial disturbance patterns across a gradient from natural to coupled human and natural disturbances. Disturbance maps achieved overall accuracies ranging from 81{\%} to 93{\%}. Disturbance patches were generally small, with 95{\%} of the disturbances being smaller than 10 ha. Disturbance rates ranged from 0.29{\%} yr−1 to 0.95{\%} yr−1, and differed substantially among management zones and study sites. Natural disturbances in strictly protected areas were longer in duration (median of 8 years) and slightly less variable in magnitude compared to human-dominated disturbances in managed forests (median duration of 1 year). However, temporal dynamics between natural and human-dominated disturbances showed strong synchrony, suggesting that disturbance peaks are driven by natural events affecting managed and unmanaged areas simultaneously. Our study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing for mapping forest disturbances in coupled human and natural systems, such as the forests of Central Europe. Yet, we also highlight the complexity of such systems in terms of agent attribution, as many natural disturbances are modified by management responding to them outside protected areas.},

In order to improve the sustainability of natural resource use, the occurrence of these conflicts and the effects that management actions have on them need to be understood. We studied the conflicts between ecosystem services and the potential to solve them by management choices in boreal production forests. Our study area consisted of nearly 30,000 forest stands which were simulated for 50 years into the future under alternative management scenarios. The study included four ecosystem services – timber production, bilberry production, carbon storage, and pest regulation – and one biodiversity conservation objective defined as availability of deadwood resources. We 1) measured the conflicts among each pair of objectives, and 2) identified a compromise solution for each pairwise conflict defined as one which simultaneously minimizes the losses for both objectives. Our results show that conflicts between timber production and other objectives are typical, severe, and difficult to solve, while non-extractive benefits including biodiversity conservation can be more easily reconciled with each other. To mitigate the most severe conflicts in boreal forests, increased diversity in management regimes is required.},

Optimizing management for multiple objectives over larger land areas likely entails trading off the practicability of the process against the goodness of the solution. It is therefore worthwhile to resolve how large areas are required as management planning regions to reconcile conflicting objectives as effectively as possible. We aimed to reveal how the extent of forestry planning regions impacts the potential to mitigate a forestry-conservation conflict in Finland, represented as a trade-off between harvest income and deadwood availability. We used forecasted data from a forest simulator, a hierarchy of forestry planning regions, and an optimization model to explore the production possibility frontier between harvest income and deadwood. We compared the overall outcomes when management was optimized within the different-sized planning regions in terms of the two objectives, the spatial variation of deadwood, and the optimal combinations of management regimes. Increasing the size of the planning regions did produce higher simultaneous levels of the two objectives, but the differences were most often of the magnitude of only a few percentages. The differences among the scales were minor also in terms of the spatial variation in deadwood availability and in the optimal management combinations. The conflict between timber harvesting and deadwood availability is only marginally easier to mitigate at large spatial scales than at small forest ownership scales. However, regardless of the spatial scale of planning, the achievable solutions may not be good enough to safeguard deadwood-dependent biodiversity without active deadwood creation.},

New infestations either occur in previously undisturbed forest stands (i.e., spot initiation) or depend on proximity to previous years' infestations (i.e., spot spreading). Early identification of newly infested trees over the forested landscape limits the effective control measures. Accurate forecasting of the spread of bark beetle infestation is crucial to plan efficient sanitation felling of infested trees and prevent further propagation of beetle-induced tree mortality. We created a predictive model of subsequent year spot initiation and spot spreading within the TANABBO decision support system. The algorithm combines open-access Landsat-based vegetation change time-series data, a digital terrain model, and forest stand characteristics. We validated predicted susceptibility to bark beetle attack (separately for spot initiation and spot spreading) against beetle infestations in managed forests in the Bohemian Forest in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) in yearly time steps from 2007 to 2010. The predictive models of susceptibility to bark beetle attack had a high degree of reliability (area under the ROC curve-AUC: 0.75-0.82). We conclude that spot initiation and spot spreading prediction modules included within the TANABBO model have the potential to help forest managers to plan sanitation felling in managed forests under pressure of bark beetle outbreak.},

This paper addresses two prerequisites that landscape ecological science has to meet for it to be effective in producing appropriate knowledge for such bottom-up landscape-development processes-it must include a valuation component, and it must be suitable for use in collaborative decision-making on a local scale. We argue that landscape ecological research needs to focus more on these issues and propose the concept of landscape services as a unifying common ground where scientists from various disciplines are encouraged to cooperate in producing a common knowledge base that can be integrated into multifunctional, actor-led landscape development. We elaborate this concept into a knowledge framework, the structure-function-value chain, and expand the current pattern-process paradigm in landscape ecology with value in this way. Subsequently, we analyse how the framework could be applied and facilitate interdisciplinary research that is applicable in transdisciplinary landscape-development processes.},

We develop new concepts and approaches to describe and measure conflicts among conservation objectives and for resolving them via multiobjective optimization. To measure conflicts we introduce a compatibility index that quantifies how much targeting a certain conservation objective affects the capacity of the landscape for providing another objective. To resolve such conflicts we find compromise solutions defined in terms of minimax regret, i.e. minimizing the maximum percent-age of deterioration among conservation objectives. Finally, we apply our approach for a case study of management for biodiversity conservation and development in a forest landscape. We study conflicts between six different forest species, and we identify management solutions for simultaneously maintaining multiple species' habitat while obtaining timber harvest revenues. We employ the method for resolving conflicts at a large landscape level across a long 50-years forest planning horizon. Our multiobjective approach can be an instrument for guiding hard choices in the conservation-development nexus with a perspective of developing decision support tools for land use planning. In our case study multiple use management and careful landscape level planning using our approach can reduce conflicts among biodiversity objectives and offer room for synergies in forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {The risk of snow and wind damage should be considered when deciding forest management actions, as it can greatly change forest development and its accompanying services. In this study, we develop models that predict snow and wind damage using management related variables as predictors. The plot level models are based on the extensive data available for Norwegian forests from four consecutive measurements of the national forest inventory along the period 1995–2014. The snow and wind risk is assessed in pure stands (pine, spruce and birch) as well as for mixed stands. Separate models are constructed for predicting the probability of a tree to be damaged, broken or uprooted. The models' descriptors include: mean diameter, mean tree slenderness, mean height, basal area and a portfolio of variables related to stand structure and composition. The models are based on generalized linear models assuming binomial or quasi-binomial distributions resulting in nine models. Mixed stands are the stands most commonly affected by snow and wind damage followed by spruce dominated stands. Spruce stands with more heterogeneous structures are less prone to suffer breakage of trees, and increasing stand height have a big impact on the risk of tree breakage. The models presented in this study can be used to create management prescriptions considering the risk of snow and wind damage. These models also help to better understand which variables make a forest more vulnerable to snow and wind damage.},

abstract = {Wind damage causes significant economic losses in boreal forests and elsewhere. Climate change may increase the occurrence of strong storms and decrease tree anchorage, making wind risk management an important aspect of future forest management. This study modeled the probability of wind throw as a function of thinning type, time since previous cutting, characteristics of the subject tree and stand, and shelter provided by adjacent upwind stands. The data were collected from two long-term silvicultural experiments, which experienced strong storm events during the past few years. The analyses showed that the most risky cutting was shelterwood cut, followed by even-aged silviculture characterized by repeated low thinnings. Cuttings where the probability of wind throw was lowest were selective high thinnings of uneven-sized stands, and dimension cutting. Very dense un-thinned stands had very low probability of wind damage. Increasing tree size, increasing height/diameter ratio, decreasing stand basal area, and decreasing basal area of adjacent upwind stands increased the probability of wind throw. Stands were most vulnerable to wind damage immediately after thinning. Uneven-sized stand structure was associated with low probability of wind throw. It was concluded that continuous cover management decreases wind damage, as compared to even-aged management.},

@article{Potterf2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V. The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) causes widespread Norway spruce (Picea abies) mortality in European forests. The pattern of landscape-level tree mortality varies over the course of beetle outbreak and by the presence and location of active breeding sites. Increased understanding of rules governing the unmanaged spread of beetle-induced tree mortality over the landscape would help to optimise management control strategies on the borderline between highly valuable protected areas and surrounding managed forests. Our study aimed to quantify the dynamics of standing tree infestation patterns from two infestation sources: windthrow and previous-year beetle infestations. Specifically, we (i) evaluated dispersal distances between the nearest infestation source and new infestations, (ii) quantified size and shape of infestation spots, (iii) modelled an infestation gradient and (iv) probability of new infestation during the incipient, peak and decline phases of beetle outbreak. Based on one- and two-year records of colour-infrared aerial photography, taken between 2005 and 2015, we identified windthrown and beetle-killed trees in the non-intervention zone of Tatra National Park, Slovakia (Central Europe). The size and compactness of infestation spots evolved from small and simple to more extended and complex shapes during beetle epidemics. In total, 40{\%} of infestations were smaller than 100 m2 and 79{\%} smaller than 500 m2. Spot growth dominated over spot initiation, with the mean spot growth extent during peak epidemic (54.8 m). Beetle infestations reached the upper tree line (1605 m a.s.l.). In total, 71{\%} of new infestations emerged within 100 m and 97{\%} within 500 m from an infestations source. Emergence of new infestations varied between infestation sources and phases of beetle outbreak. New beetle infestations emerged near windthrown locations during incipient and peak phases and near source beetle infestations during peak and decline phases following inverse power-law function. We found that the forest within 100 m from the active infestation compared to more distant buffers had the highest risk of infestations. The distance to previous-year infestations should be considered as one of the main factors in determining the risk of subsequent tree mortality, especially if other predictors are absent. If the active wind disturbances or beetle infestations neighbour the border of the unmanaged protected area, the search and sanitation felling of active breeding trees should be concentrated within 500 m from the border of unmanaged protected areas in order to restrain the spread of beetle infestations from nature reserve to surrounding managed forests.},

abstract = {This study presented a new method for considering the risk of wind damage in forest planning and for predicting the amount of damage and its effects on timber production, economic profitability and carbon balance of forestry. The effects of wind damage on the optimal management of boreal forests under current and changing climatic conditions were analyzed by comparing four forest management plans. A reference plan maximized net present value (NPV) with even-flow harvesting constraints. The second plan minimized height differences between adjacent stands and the third minimized height differences while simultaneously maximizing NPV. The fourth plan maximized height differences between adjacent stands. To obtain damage-adjusted results, schedules that belonged to the optimal management plans were simulated with wind damage, taking into account the shelter provided by adjacent stands. Maximizing NPV and simultaneously minimizing height differences resulted in the highest damage-adjusted NPV. Increasing wind ...},
