# 
# Recreate complex landscape for the optimal solutions
# 

# Read .csv files of optimal solutions
# if there is not 1.0 solution: 
# keep only stand that has higher proportion of the regime
# Based on the scenarios, subset the individual simulated stands
# ----------------------------------

# Need to:
# read the .csv  files from simulated data
# read the optimal solution
# filter the simulated data by solutions
# read the stand geometry, calculate open_edge and wind risk
